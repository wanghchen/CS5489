""" i finished shooting the blue kite in 1992 . but while i was involved in post-production , several official organizations involved with china's film industry screened the film . they decided that it had a problem concerning its political 'leanings , ' and prevented its completion . the fact that it can appear today seems like a miracle . . . the stories in the film are real , and they are related with total sincerity . what worries me is that it is precisely a fear of reality and sincerity that has led to the ban on such stories being told . "" - tian zhuangzhuang , director of the blue kite it is a troubling climate , where nothing is certain , and the greatest difficulty of growing up lies in determining what is proper behavior and what is likely to get you taken away for "" reform . "" it is shujuan and tietou's struggles through this and subsequent trials that form the background of tian zhuangzhuang's motion picture . tian's criticism of the chinese revolution is effective because of its subtlety . as was true in chen kaige's farewell my concubine , the characters' stories are used to present the injustices of the system . if anything , the methods employed in this film are less direct than those in concubine , but no less disturbing . the acting by the principles , especially that of chen xiaoman and lu liping , is superb . lu's unaffected presentation of the spectrum of human emotions creates a very real shujuan . tian's method of storytelling , while reasonably straightforward , will be unfamiliar to many american movie-goers . careful attention to the story is demanded , especially for those unfamiliar with the background . because numerous scenes end abruptly and are often followed by sudden time changes , it's easy to lose track of what's going on in the blue kite . we in the west should feel fortunate to be exposed to such well-crafted , provocative motion pictures .",JBe
"well , as outlandish and ridiculous as the remake is , the original manages to be slightly worse . the original is a somnolent little treatise on the minutia of living near the ocean . careful never to offend anyone and taking absolutely no risks , the show meanders until is finally put to sleep by a benevolent editor ( warren adams ) . director james b . clark's specialty is children's b movies , having directed such unmemorable films as a dog of flanders , island of the blue dolphins , my side of the mountain , and the little ark . here he makes his only well known film , and why it was so successful is beyond this critic . yes , the dolphin star is photogenic , but he gets much less screen time the actors . since there really is no plot , a summary seems superfluous , but let me tell you all you need to know . needless to say , the big storm sounds ferocious but its effects are fairly tame . most scenes are of little consequence . most of the show is dominated by the loud violins whose sole purpose seems to be to anesthetize the audience . perhaps he does , but not in this show . other than flipper , who is cute , the only other aspect of the film with any merit is the cinematography by lamar boren and joseph brun . they produce warm pastel shades that give a surreal and yet nostalgic look to the sets . it is not rated , but would get a g today . there is no sex , nudity , or even mildly offensive language . he actually likes the original better than the remake , which he also likes . i hate them both , but if forced at gunpoint to watch one of them again , i'd go for the remake . at least it takes some risks and has a few imaginative scenes . i give the original just barely  .",SRh
"screenplay : joel coen , ethan coen & sam raimi . director : joel coen . the coen brothers are : a ) a pair of intellectual dilettante/pop cannibals whose films lack any kind of soul . b ) a pair of brilliant visual stylists who manipulate genre into something completely original . your choice will probably tell you all you need to know about how you would react to the hudsucker proxy . coen brothers fans will revel in their delightfully off-center perspective and their twisted sense of humor ; their detractors will grouse over their cold mechanics and inaccessibility . and both sides will be correct . fortunately , there is more that dazzles than there is that distracts . that buffoon is norville barnes . however , norville has at least one trick up his sleeve . many of those off-putting elements which have limited the coens' appeal are still in place . director joel is given to wild , manic set pieces and near constant camera movement , which often seem to yell , "" look at me , i'm a director ! "" fans of vintage cinema note that their spins on established genres read like film school projects : make a "" film noir , "" make a gangster film . the hudsucker proxy clearly owes most of its inspiration to frank capra's meet john doe , with nods to sturges and hawks along the way . at a certain point , however , homage gives way to parody ; jennifer jason leigh's clipped katherine hepburn/barbara stanwyck delivery is cute for a while but eventually becomes annoying , while paul newman simply seems cartoonish as the snarling , cigar-chomping wheeler dealer . but perhaps most disappointing is the character of norville , whom the coens and co-scripter sam raimi didn't seem to have any interest in making interesting . there's almost a mockery of capra's everyman heroes , who were simple but always imbued with common sense . consequently , it's hard to care about anything except what is on the surface . of course , there is plenty more going on on the surface of a coen brothers film than any dozen other films put together . dennis gassner's production design is part gotham city , part brazil , but stunningly evocative in its own right , while carter burwell provides a fantastic and diverse score . however , it is with two magnificent visual pieces that hudsucker makes its mark . there are dozens of individually memorable moments , lines and scenes , which makes it all the more frustrating that they aren't supported by a memorable story . with triumphant films like miller's crossing and barton fink , the coens have established themselves as among the most original filmmakers of their generation . still , it has only been on rare occasions that they have appeared as concerned with creating characters as they have with framing shots . the hudsucker proxy is worth seeing for its quirky invention , but it's hard not to wish that so much talent could come with a little more heart .",SRe
"mpaa rating : unrated running time : 45 minutes . these were basketball fans -- how could they not appreciate a tale of the greatest basketball player yet to walk the earth ? it is testimony to the astonishing appeal of michael jordan that even those partisans who should despise him still can't help admiring him . he is the sort of larger-than-life figure it seems was born for a big screen documentary -- and in a very limited sense , that's true . the early moments of the film touch on pieces that added to his mystique . there's the pounding theme of the alan parsons project's "" mammagamma "" that made chicago bull player introductions a spectacle unto itself . and there's a montage of jordan's legacy of ridiculous , physics-defying shots . he's such an unearthly presence in the film that i began to believe he could change history -- even though i knew chicago had lost one of the playoff games featured , i was still surprised that the last-second shot jordan took to win the game didn't actually go in . if all one was looking for from michael jordan to the max was a sense of his legend writ two stories high , i suppose you could say it was an unqualified success . but there's such an emphasis on jordan's inhuman will to win that his humanity isn't often in evidence . sure , there are scenes of jordan fooling around with kids at a basketball camp , and an effective sequence capturing the ever-present crush of fans that made his every movement a running of the gauntlet . there's just not much sense of what makes jordan tick . even when the player himself speaks , it's primarily in the well-rehearsed platitudes of a professional athlete : "" i never doubted myself ; "" "" you have to pursue your dream ; "" etc . it's a shock when we see jordan getting misty-eyed while discussing his relationship with his father , because it's such an unusually unguarded moment . it may be unreasonable to expect a piercingly insightful documentary in this particular format . imax presentations have carved out visions of the awe-inspiring as their unique dominion , and jordan certainly fits that description . instead of taking viewers into the center of real-time basketball games -- in effect , allowing them to be on the court with the legend -- kempf and stern use slow-motion for most of their game shots . they don't even bother to maintain chronology within individual games ( one disadvantage of the big screen is that you can see the scoreboard in virtually every shot , making it obvious when the film has jumped back a quarter or two just for the sake of a cool image ) . michael jordan to the max is all about its star power , the kind that even appeals to a theater full of jazz fans who would wish for a different kind of changed history . as a big-screen experience , it's all about keeping a hero larger than life . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .",SRe
"in a year that has seen numerous "" boy's-point-of-view "" stories , this is one of the better entries . however , instead of going for the nostalgia and sentimentality that many of these movies attempt , tito and me is basically a straightforward tale with a light touch and a serious message . zoran is forced to face the disappointing truth that childhood heros are often little more than self-constructed icons with personalities nothing like those attributed to them by a worshipful youth . the most interesting portion of tito and me is the first half , which concentrates on zoran's home and school life . his initial relationship with jasna is presented realistically with all the uncertainty of a child's first crush , and the confused interaction of the two families living within zoran's house is at once funny and poignant . the latter half of the film deals with the walking tour through yugoslavia's hinterlands , and this is only fitfully successful as zoran's disillusionment is brought forcefully to the fore . some of the comedy during these sequences seems both out-of-place and occasionally cruel . there's a lot of comedy in this film - some overt , but as much subtle . tito and me often succeeds because of its light tone ; a lugubrious movie with the same sort of message could easily turn the audience off or put them to sleep . with the exception of lazar ristovski , whose buffoonish raja is over-the- top , the acting is excellent . young dimitrie vojnov should especially be singled out for his natural , unaffected performance as zoran . it is in large part due to his effortless portrayal that tito and me is effective . numerous black-and-white clips of the real tito are used throughout the film and , while these are interesting for historical reasons , they create a slight artistic problem . the actor who plays tito ( voja brajovic ) looks absolutely nothing like the real man . as a result , with so many shots of the legitimate figure , it becomes difficult to accept the actor in the role . tito and me is a fine , fresh motion picture with a universal theme . you don't have to have been raised in 1954 yugoslavia to understand or enjoy this movie , which has a deceptively strong message for such a breezy tone .",JBe
"there's a quiet brilliance about this melancholy chamber piece , that is much enhanced by the artistic cinematography of nino gaetano martinetti . it's a film for those who appreciate oddities in filmmaking and are not deterred by the slightness of the story or the slow way it gets to where it's going .",DSc
"this is a dogma 95 styled film , where the danish filmmaker's group manifesto determines the rules for how the film is to be made . the idea is to give their films a fresh look and for them to provide the unexpected , and to catch on film the complete truth from its characters and their situations . this film was shot with a small video camera ( a sony pc7 ) that fits in the palm of your hand , then it is transferred to the prescribed dogma 35-millimeter format . i suppose it is fair to assume that one of the reasons that this manifesto was drawn up in 1995 by four danish filmmakers--christian levring , soren kragh-jacobsen , thomas vinterberg , and lars von trier-- was to give them publicity and challenge the film community to create innovative films . so far the only two films i saw from this group , von trier's the idiots & breaking the waves , have been challenging and impressive films . for those interested in what their dogma document actually states , i give you the following example : "" 2 . the sound must never be produced apart from the image or vice versa . any movement or immobility attainable in the hand is permitted . the film must be in color . special lighting is not acceptable . ( if there is too little light for exposure , the scene must be cut or a single lamp [must] be attached to the camera . ) "" 6 . the film must not contain superficial action . is to say that the film takes place here and now . ) "" 8 . genre movies are not acceptable . "" 10 . the director must not be credited . "" furthermore , i swear as a director to refrain from personal taste ! i am no longer an artist . i swear to refrain from creating a 'work , ' as i regard the instant as more important than the whole . my supreme goal is to force the truth out of my characters and settings . i swear to do so by all the means available and at the cost of any good taste and any aesthetic considerations . "" rules like that rub me the wrong way . what i ask from a film , is for it to be imaginative and well-made , and i don't particularly care how the filmmaker accomplishes that . it would be impossible to go into the minute details of the film without immeasurably spoiling it for the viewer who hasn't seen the film . my pleasure in seeing it was that i was caught completely unaware of what was to occur and that shock kept me absorbed in the story , not quite knowing what to expect next . this might be the secret reason why the film worked so well , as i was made to feel like one of the guests in this theatrical film . the result of the film was exhilerating , dogma or not , it is a work that is scathing , penetrating layers of deceit and festering wounds that cannot be healed . but it was to no avail . to point out how the guests weren't quite sure of anything that was happening there , they are shown eating lobster , or salmon , or tomato soup , each one unsure of what they were served . the celebration is indeed a celebration not to be forgotten soon . it drains the emotions , somehow satisfies the intellect , and challenges the conventions of the usual fare of sophisticated family drama . vinterberg declares how the impact of helge's revelation affected everyone in the immediate family , and how that acted as a cleansing for the tribe , something that was essential for their psyches . at least , they now have some kind of a shot of pulling themselves together , even though the film does not show any of them changing internally . and how the film accomplished this , was through good storytelling , where one doesn't need any false constraints , something that is reminiscent of greek tragedy or shakespearean drama .",DSc
"i thought of this group as i suffered through sylvester stallone latest action thriller , daylight . i lost count of how many times i laughed out loud at the wrong places . characters were dying , and i could not keep from laughing ; the circumstances were so ridiculous . one could make a cogent argument that action films should be evaluated mainly on the special effects and the stunts . by that metric , daylight delivers . not a great special effects movie , but a perfectly acceptable one . in the best part , a firestorm barbecues everything in its path . not quite as impressive as in chain reaction , but still pretty awesome . personally , i found the action sequences in daylight more tedious than exhilarating , but maybe i am too demanding . in a cliche infested story , we have a convoy of truckers taking toxic waste through the holland tunnel on way to new jersey to dump it . now , there is a concept -- faxes as car burglar alarm replacements . so wild-eyed is the driver that , as he hits every car in the tunnel , i began to wonder if the film was intended as a parody of bad action movies . the person who says it can't be done is always interrupted by the person who just did it . "" they should have a place for you to check your brain in the lobby of the theater . i lost count of all the nonsensical parts . consider just two typical examples . the fans are computer controlled and can be stopped only once and for just three minutes . sure . how many times do they get cold ? once . the seriousness which director rob cohen ( dragonheart ) attaches to this farce could be summed up by one of the convicts . he asks , "" listen , if we don't die in here , i wondered if i could give you a call ? "" it is rated pg-13 for numerous scenes of death and destruction . if your kids can not handle heavy violence , do not take them to this show . my guess is that this means the film is not for anyone under at least ten . i enjoyed laughing at the ludicrousness of the picture , but i would not suggest that anyone else have to sit through this preposterous story . i give the movie  only for the action sequences .",SRh
"despite their radically different compositions , both groups have a lot in common . just like abba twenty years ago , the spice girls are pop wonders who manage to rise consistently to the top of the music charts despite the essential vapidity of their hits . now , for better or worse , the spice girls have done something that abba never did : starred in a movie . it's worth noting at the outset that i am definitely not a member of the target audience for this movie . i'm also not a spice girls fan . actually , going into the film , i was rather neutral towards them . they may be pleasant to look at , but their irritating antics as presented here are enough to put someone off of them permanently . suffice it to say that i won't be buying the soundtrack . the movie's premise is as flimsy as can be , but it least it doesn't require a whole lot of acting from the main quintet of baby spice ( emma bunton ) , ginger spice ( geri halliwell ) , scary spice ( melanie brown ) , sporty spice ( melanie chisholm ) , and posh spice ( victoria adams ) . in the end , however , they triumph over all adversity and wow their fans . the press package for spice world makes the jaw-dropping statement that the film is "" a '90s version of a hard day's night with a pinch of this is spinal tap and a dash of speed "" . time for a reality check . any similarities between spice world and those three films are entirely superficial . the speed citation points to a brief parody of a high- speed bus chase , and nothing more . no aspect of spice world's occasional pseudo-documentary approach comes close to the acid edge achieved by spinal tap . and , although the film is clearly trying to follow in the footsteps of the beatles' classic , it's several long strides behind , lacking the same sense of originality , spontaneity , high energy , and joi de vie . not to mention the differences in music quality . a hard day's night was a breath of fresh air ; spice world is recycled . sadly , however , spiers doesn't generate enough laughter here , and even the "" name the next familiar face "" game can't save the film . although the spice girls , who appear comfortable in front of the camera , are the headliners , there are a few legitimate performers in the film . richard e . grant leads the pack as an intentionally over-the-top neurotic who quickly got on my nerves . alan cumming , barry humphries , george wendt ( as an american movie producer ) , richard o'brien ( best known as riff raff from the rocky horror picture show ) , and claire rushbrook ( as the girls' assistant ) all have more than a few seconds of screen time . spice world is a vanity project -- an ego trip designed to show the five girls in the best possible light and give them a chance to perform about 14 numbers on-screen . as a comedy , it's weak , because most of the jokes are obvious and not especially funny . as a satire , it's weaker , because the screenplay never takes any chances and all of the mini parodies are safe , silly , and creatively lifeless . the film isn't even a particularly good musical , because the songs are so inane . the only people who are likely to be able to sit through spice world without casting numerous yearning glances at the exit are those who number themselves among the group's legion of die-hard fans . ultimately , this film has too much spice and not enough flavoring . - ingmar bergman",JBe

"where are the flying cows when you really need them ? dante's peak is obviously predicated on the dubious idea that bigger is better . 1996's twister brought in hundreds of millions at the box office by showcasing relatively small ( if something so destructive can be gauged as "" small "" ) natural disasters -- namely , tornadoes . the next logical step would be to go for something larger and more devastating . apparently , hurricanes weren't deemed visually impressive enough and earthquakes have been done to death , so hollywood has set its sights on volcanoes with not one , but two , similarly-themed disaster flicks . let's just hope volcano shows a glimmer more intelligence , not to mention a higher energy level , than dante's peak . no one is ever going to accuse twister of being a masterpiece of originality , but , as roller-coaster movie go , it's a great deal of fun . part of the reason is the effective use of audio and visual effects ; the other part is that director jan de bont knows how to get the adrenaline flowing . twister is a rush . dante's peak , on the other hand , is a bore . oh , it has its moments , but most of them are concentrated in the final forty-five minutes . the first hour , which is all typical disaster movie setup , is interminable . in keeping with time-tested formulas , we have a male/female pairing , children and animals in danger , a voice of reason that no one listens to until its too late , and a character with a tragedy in the past . the first hour of dante's peak is spent getting to know the characters . not that we need that much time , since they're all familiar types . if you manage to stay awake through fifty-five minutes of drivel , you'll be rewarded with some nifty special effects as the mountain throws everything it has at the town : fire , water , air , and earth . it's pretty impressive , i admit , but there's an unwelcome sense of deja vu . as recently as the aforementioned twister , we've already been there and done that , and it was a lot more enjoyable last time around . brosnan and hamilton gamely try to generate some chemistry , and , while both are appealing in their own right , the moronic plotline and dumb dialogue defeat them at nearly every turn . it will come as no surprise for astute viewers to learn that the screenwriter for dante's peak , leslie bohem , also wrote stallone's daylight . both movies feature some similarly embarrassing bad lines . meanwhile , director roger donaldson ( no way out , the getaway ) fails repeatedly to do anything interesting to enliven the proceedings . even discounting the first hour , dante's peak still isn't all that satisfying . i suppose there's a certain degree of tension as harry and company flee rivers of molten lava and volcanic shockwaves in their attempt to get out of town before it's buried in ash , but , with everything being done according to a well-established formula , the level of excitement stays low . once the film is over , you'll likely acknowledge that , although there's some nice eye candy , the experience as a whole leaves something to be desired . and there aren't even any flying cows to redeem the situation .",JBe

"" before getting into the heart of the review , let me comment first on the real star -- the spectacular special effects . the river of lava has a realism and a power that needs to be seen to be appreciated . more interesting , however , is the way in which the movie hints at the volcano's force through steam that blows off the manhole covers . the film is both involving and intriguing during this whole exploration phase . then the script by jerome armstrong and billy ray makes the classic horror movie mistake , rushing the monster , a . a . the lava , onto the screen too quickly because they lack confidence in their ability to hold the audience's attention with mere suspense . lots of action and big explosions -- now , that will make the audience feel they got their seven bucks worth and make them tell their friends to see that awesome movie . this second act , which takes more than three quarters of the film , outwears its welcome . periodically fun , but too often tedious . the plausible chemistry between them never becomes overblown , and the usual big fight between the leads never occurs . the second problem with the script concerns the small human melodramas . whereas the overall logic of the picture is presented plausibly enough for a movie , the unbelievable heroics of the minor actors begin to take a toll on your brain . would you stay with someone in an exploding building just because they were trapped ? would you jump into a river of lava carrying a dying man instead of jumping safely across by yourself ? even though director mick jackson cannot save the sagging script , the actors and the special effects keep your attention . he manages to take the film's mundane dialog and breath life into it . his character becomes at once both funny and strong . the script could have paced the long second act better by feeding him some decent humorous fare . jacqui kim ( disclosure ) takes the poorly written role of the noble dr . jaye calder and transform it into a mildly interesting character . volcano , despite its faults , does entertain a crowd . memorable ? hardly , but the main actors are worth seeing , and that first act has so much promise it almost makes you want to forgive them for blowing the second . it is rated pg-13 for the intensity of the disaster and the associated injuries . depending on how well your child can handle disaster movies , the film could be seen by kids as young as 8 , but it would be too much for our 8-year-old . the trailers for it scared him badly so we certainly would not take him . i recommend the film for its entertainment value and give it  . if you can only see one volcano movie this year , then this is the one to see .",SRh

"kristin scott thomas's narration occupies only about ninety seconds of the dazzling documentary microcosmos , which made it even easier to hear every comment in an audience composed largely of families with young children . ordinarily , the prospect of an afternoon spent with a crowd of garrulous youngsters might send me screaming for an iv drip of valium , but the 75 minutes i spent in microcosmos may have been the most uplifting 75 minutes i've spent in a theater in years . here were 9- and 10-year-olds asking questions about insects , enraptured by the natural world , chattering excitedly in the lobby afterwards about their favorite scenes . it was one of those rare occasions when a film left me a bit more optimistic about our collective future as inquisitive beings . it is a simple enough concept ( though the process was anything but simple ) , but what makes microcosmos so consistently enthralling is the ability of nuridsany and perennou to find stories in their tiny subjects , stories which give them a personality . mating is not shown in clinical detail with a dry narrative description -- instead , two snails meet , caress and embrace in a strangely beautiful moment set to a soaring aria . in perhaps the film's most memorable sequence , a sacred scarab beetle rolls a small ball of dung until he is halted by a briar jutting out of the ground . the ability of that sequence to turn a beetle into a hero demonstrates that nuridsany and perennou have a talent most feature film-makers only dream about . most of us have seen nature footage of birds or amphibians which made the insects the insects upon which they snacked insignificant bit players in the food chain . microcosmos is like a novel based on another novel's supporting characters , turning sub-plots into life stories . one exceptional shot captures the bird's eye through the entrance to the ants' tunnels like an ogre peeping through a keyhole at his prey ; another represents the bird as a monstrous shadow . the film-makers want to show you parts of our world you may have taken for granted , and to show you in a way which grabs you as a narrative as much as an entomology lesson . in fact , the only time microcosmos sags is when it does resemble conventional nature footage . it is interesting watching a spider speed-wrap a grasshopper caught in its web , but it is a purely intellectual interest ; the same is true of a spider which constructs a kind of underwater diving bell for itself . these are moments which might make you go "" hmmm , "" but they don't fascinate you like a battle between stag beetles which seems to personalize the combatants . yet one of the best moments in the stag beetle sequence is a seemingly throwaway scene of another , smaller insect being tossed to the ground during the titanic struggle like a nameless patron in a western bar room brawl . it seems that even within this world there are supporting characters , and the wonderful thing about microcosmos is that you find yourself waiting for nuridsany and perennou to follow the unfortunate fellow on his own adventure , to the delight of children and adults alike .",SRe
"screenplay/director : kevin smith . for the past few years , filmmakers have been trying to capture what it is that defines the generation which has thus far been difficult even to name . so-called "" generation x "" films like singles ; bodies , rest & motion ; and reality bites have tried , but their target audience seems to have rejected those attempts . at first glance , clerks appears to be cut from the same cloth , a bargain basement variation on tales of cynical , over-qualified and under-achieving whiners . made for a paltry $36 , 000 by writer/director kevin smith , clerks frequently shows its low-budget roots in performances which can charitably be called amateurish . brian o'halloran has an easy-going and engaging presence , but he's often far too broad in his physical acting . only lisa spoonhauer as the sexy and sharp caitlin puts much real spark into her performance . smith's direction is simple , but his insistence on swinging his camera back and forth in two-character scenes also proves distracting . like go fish earlier this year , clerks is occasionally just a bit too clunky to be completely endearing . the episodes which make up clerks are of inconsistent quality , but the good ones are very good . the dialogue is filled with ultra-crude observations which almost earned clerks an nc-17 rating , but they're caustic and on-target . randal in particular , who acts both as the devil on dante's shoulder and as the real voice of reason in clerks , gets some marvelous lines , though virtually every one of them is unprintable . less effective are sequences involving a roller hockey game on the store's roof which simply lasts too long , and a montage of annoying customer types which is a bit is too cutesy . but clerks turns out to be more than just the sum of its parts . kevin smith places himself in the awkward position of chastising those who are most likely to be his audience , and it is that daring that makes clerks most worthy of admiration ; it is not often that personal responsibility is the moral to a story . while he may not have had all the tools at his disposal that a studio filmmaker would have had to tell this story , kevin smith did have a story to tell . clerks is unquestionably uneven , but it is also a very funny wake-up call to the over-the-counter culture .",SRe
"his slow but steady transformation into political awareness is the most reassuring omen sent out in this non-didactic , straight forward ambitious project of sayles . the strength that comes from such a story , is in the telling of it and the powerful images presented . the problem with all this , is that since no specific country was named , it must mean that sayles considers this to be a universal problem , and that makes the problem gigantic , with no one to be specifically blamed , especially since these kind of human abuses have been going on for ages , it becomes difficult to zero in on what can be done to prevent such happenings . the other problem is that one can get the feeling that there reaches a point where one feels he is being manipulated , that there is so little that can be done by individuals alone , that governments have to be held accountable for their actions , and people have to be aware of what their governments are doing , even if , most of all , people have to learn how to help themselves . this is a very strong , independent minded picture , that chooses to tell a very difficult story , one that not many people will take comfort in . but the question arises as to how the message of such despair will get out to people who are so far removed from that isolated part of the world . it seems that this film might have some influence , but there is little that individuals who are not from that region can do , as proof we have just to look at the terrors faced by those in this film who tried to help . dennis schwartz : movie reviews ozus @sover . net",DSc

"" suffice it to say that he is no robin williams . to be fair to dan castellaneta , the plot for the return of jafar can be summarized as let's get the old cast together , have them cavort in the same settings , sing some songs and generally kill the minimum amount of time necessary for something to be called a movie rather than a short . in this case , the picture does fill 66 minutes of video tape and can , therefore , just barely be legitimately referred to as a feature length movie . with his toothy smile and boyish good looks , aladdin is back along with his gorgeous girlfriend jasmine , wearing her same slightly revealing costume . their voices are done by scott weinger and linda larkin and , like most of the rest of the cast with the exception of williams , are the same as in the original . in a movie about which it is hard to find positive things to say , the songs , while far from memorable , at least are tuneful and full of energy . before watching this tape , we tried the 1970 movie scrooge with albert finney , where the songs are so pitiful that they sound more like sung dialog . the songs in the return of jafar , none of which i can remember now , did have at least possess plenty of pep and sounded like real songs . jafar ( jonathan freeman ) with his sinister little goatee is up to his old tricks -- like most of this unimaginative movie , there are few new tricks . the show plays more like a series of outtakes from the original than a sequel . the only way you can tell this is not the case is the absence of williams . the jokes are not particularly funny or original . even disney's usual superlative animation isn't up to par . looking at the credits , it appears that much of the drawing was farmed out . all and all , the return of jafar is a pretty lame film . the return of jafar runs 1 : 06 , which means less than an hour if you exclude the credits . it is not rated but would be a g and is suitable for all ages . my son jeffrey , age 8 , thought it was "" pretty good , "" and claimed he liked it almost as much as the original since the same characters are back .",SRh

"one of the really haunting films of the 1990s . a film about a life hitting a wall and taking the starch out of a young person's sense of being . it is so painful to see what existence means and doesn't mean to a teenage girl , that it is hard to look at this film without thinking of it as a documentary . its underlying theme is about the impossibility of leading a moral life and being moral , that no matter what one does , existence supercedes everything else . she played the role with conviction and gave a truly unforgettable performance . the dardenne brothers have made an urgent film about today's job market that hits home on its universal pathos and how those on the bottom are taken advantage of by unfair employment practices . it's a theme that forces you to look at the young girl in an introspective way and at her poverty as something that is real and not something that can be dismissed by other distractions in the story . rosetta's life is more reflective of how ordinary americans manage to scrape by and actually exist , than in all the ludicrous themes of the escape films most americans flock to see . this film is rich in all the things about life that hollywood chooses to gloss over in its need to get a blockbuster film . its star does not exude beauty and is not faced with episodic adventures . they have created a masterfully perfect visceral film , that is unflinching in its realism and unsentimental in its study of her . what makes this film so uncompromising and ironical , is that we are not asked to like or even accept rosetta , we are only allowed to understand that she does what she has to in order to exist . isn't that the way life really is , anyway ? i found a job , you got a job . i got a friend , you got a friend . i will not fall in a rut , you will not fall in a rut . i will lead a normal life , you will lead a normal life . in many ways , her story is ours , there are no national borders to separate us from such agony . there is nothing more important for most people in the world than in securing a job , and there are very few films that take the pains to show that getting a job is so serious a matter . i think that the film critics who downplayed this film into the minor category because of its lack of action and tedium , missed a chance to see a film that had much more to offer than the usual type of escapist entertainment fare . this film has the distinction of being troublingly unique , it is devoid of any philosophy , it is even different from bresson's "" mouchette , "" a masterful film it is most closely akin to . bresson had too many religious and catholic agendas in his film to achieve the starkness this film does . this is a film made for purists of the cinema , those who don't want to see another disposable film , but who wish to see a film that is unmistakably direct , a film that they can see themselves in if they are not too calloused and frightened of life to look at the dark side . it is society's mistake if they make someone like rosetta invisible , and it is our mistake as filmgoers and critics if we ignore films just because they bring up unpleasant subjects and we don't feel entertained by them . to be so prosaic in our viewing habits as that , we would be on the same slippery footing as rosetta , striving for the same kind of ridiculous normalcy she was after .",DSc

"a bitter-sweet fantasy , in the form of a black comedy . this is the first film he's done that's not written by him , as it was scripted by john c . richards/james flamberg . it is another heartless stab by the director aimed at the heart of mankind , showing them at their stupidest and cruelest moments , one that tweaks the sensibilities about american pop culture and its whimsical effect on the population . it uses the ridiculous banal plot of a soap opera called 'a reason to love' and manages to get a story that runs parallel . this modern adult fairy tale , told in the style of the "" wizard of oz , "" is also set in kansas and has the heroine , ala dorothy , leaving that rational state for one of fantasy . the humor comes in how the characters actually fall for the fantasy they are spoon fed by tv . she never misses an episode and identifies solely with a nurse chloe , even knowing the nurse's lines by heart . it would take a suspension of disbelief to take in what ensued after the murder and not question it . the film has another gory murder scene , as it breaks the mood of fantasy and returns to a reality that is even more absurd than the fantasy world . a bloody shootout occurs and everything that can get straightened out does as a result of that . but it was not possible for me to believe anything about this tale , especially the purported sweet ending tried for . this tale was spiced with too much human depravity and insanity , making betty to be anything but another dorothy gale , but more like a crazy person or an idiot . i found this adult fairy tale to be one that was trapped in its own mixture of cynicism and delusions . the director could never quite decide on what he wanted betty to be like , so i was left with the impression that she was a cartoon-like character , not able to distinguish what was real or fantasy . i don't think the film has come up with some earth shattering things to say about pop culture , except to imply that if you want to be a moron and forego taste , then join the middle-brow masses and get absorbed in soap operas and forego any kind of art that makes you think for yourself . if you do , the director is saying , that is not the worst thing that can happen to you , it doesn't have to kill you . but it is never clear what labute thinks of this , that is , after smashing the middle-class dream of america as something that is drab . is he further saying that it is better to have some dream no matter how futile it is than no dream at all ? if his other two nihilistic films are examples of his thinking , then i think he is trying to bring that same message into this work , even though it might not have been intended in this script and doesn't exactly jive with the sweet ending tried for . i just think it seemed like old hat material recycled . what the film had going for it was some marvelous performances , especially by morgan freeman , who touched the soul of his complicated character , a wickedly carnal performance from chris rock , and from greg kinnear , who caught the subtlety needed for his role , to swing back and forth between tv actor and real character . as for ren ? e zellweger's performance , it was good , that is , as good as any on the soaps .",DSc
"almodovar . to those familiar with his body of work , that name is more than just a way to identify one of today's premiere directors -- it offers valuable insight into the scope and intent of a movie . since his debut in 1980 with pepi , luci , bom , almodovar has been the "" bad boy "" of spanish cinema . his films have been offbeat , energetic , and wildly stylistic ( often to the point of garishness ) . with titles like women on the verge of a nervous breakdown , tie me up ! tie me down ! , and kika , almodovar has constantly challenged his audience about some of the essential themes of life : sex , love , and violence . he pushes the envelope in a way that many film makers are uncomfortable even attempting . watch tie me up ! if you doubt this statement . with live flesh , based loosely on a novel by ruth rendell , almodovar is back in fine form , yet signs of restraint are evident in nearly every frame of this movie . by toning down his visual flourishes and curbing his tendencies towards excess , almodovar has created what might be the finest work of his career to date . live flesh is a superb , sublime motion picture that uses a quintet of fascinating characters to examine a few of the director's favorite concepts . live flesh is really a mystery , which is why i won't give a more detailed plot description . this isn't a crime thriller , however -- it's an exploration of characters' motives , secrets , and true emotions . while there is a little gunplay , the core of live flesh lies in the complexity of how these five individuals interact . these are rich , believable individuals involved in relationships that defy the facile conventions of what movies typically present as romances , friendships , and rivalries . the ending is surprising , not because it doesn't fit , but because , knowing all that we do about the involved parties , it's the perfect way to offer closure to the tale . for live flesh's leads , the director gives us five strong performers . the one who leaves the strongest impression is italian actress francesca neri , who , as elena , successfully balances fear , pity , and a deeply-rooted sense of longing . of the three men , javier bardem ( jamon jamon ) has the most difficult part -- showing the dark side of a person we naturally have sympathy for . jose sancho smolders as the violent , conflicted sancho , and , in the role with the most screen time , liberto rabal shows that while he may have the look and physique of a model , he has talent as an actor . almodovar isn't denying the value of romance , but he's emphasizing the complexities of any love-based relationship and affirming that sex is far from irrelevant . one of the most delicious aspects of live flesh is its keen sense of irony . yet there is never a time when almodovar's appreciation of offbeat comedy endangers the integrity of the characters or the story . like the gorgeous cinematography ( which is used to good effect to eroticize a sex scene ) , this is all part of almodovar's stylistic package . never has it been more impressive than here , where everything ( not just the flesh ) is vibrant with life . - ingmar bergman",JBe

"if you've always been curious about exactly what heaven and hell look like , what dreams may come offers some intriguing suggestions . in director vincent ward's long cinematic sermon on the advantages of a moral life , the movie depicts heaven as a happy , colorful landscape painting and hell as an eerie , gray , holocaust graveyard overflowing with talking heads . the rarely subtle film shows two dead children from inside their coffins during the opening credits . both are deeply scarred characters who share their troubles with us in almost every scene . if the movie were involving , it could have been the downer of the year . instead , it stays at the level of visual technical achievements with the figures in it about as real as those in art gallery paintings -- lovely to look at , but nothing to get concerned over . gooding , like the rest of the fine actors , is largely wasted in a movie that works only at an ethereal level . the magical film is artistically surreal but only sporadically realistic . the script by ronald bass , based on richard matheson's novel , could have used a little more levity and should have given the characters some credible depth .

"" how often has "" entertainment "" in the blockbuster era been defined as "" tens of millions of dollars thrown at a production that began without a completed script ? "" critics cringe as the first of may draws near , knowing that a cadre of hollywood film-makers who consider themselves "" just entertainers "" will be spewing forth grotesquely inept stories peppered with explosions and digital effects . with such images in mind , i shouldn't diminish gladiator by tossing out so banal a word as "" entertaining "" -- but it is . i shouldn't succumb to the temptation to describe it with ad-copy buzzwords like "" spectacular ! "" or "" dazzling ! "" or "" epic ! "" -- but it is . movies just don't get much more fundamentally satisfying on so many levels -- simple without being simplistic , grand in scope without losing track of its basic appeal . the story is , to put it bluntly , older than the roman empire : reluctant-but-impossibly-noble hero fights against great odds to bring low a regal-but-impossibly-dastardly villain . it has been done and done and done again , because when it's done well , few stories are as viscerally effective . and gladiator does it remarkably well . crowe plays maximus as straight as he can possibly be played , giving him an iconic grandeur ; it's the kind of role that makes actors into movie stars . the late oliver reed also scores in his final role as the casually cynical proximo . every one of them is playing a standard film type ; every one of them refuses to submit to the notion that a type can't be played with energy and commitment . as a basic film story , gladiator is lean and effective . and it's not too bad as a visual treat , either . copious use of digital effects is de rigeur for epic genre films circa 2000 , yet there is nothing remotely obligatory or pointlessly showy about gladiator's re-creation of ancient rome . it's stunning work that raises the ruins of the colosseum and captures both the magnificence and the casual brutality of the culture . it is becoming a hollywood clich to claim that "" every dollar is up there on the screen , "" but that's the way gladiator feels . the execution of its technical detail is so precise that it never feels like more or less than exactly what is necessary to complement the story . if there's a weak link to gladiator , it's the amount of time devoted to roman political intrigue . the imperial/republican squabbling and back-stabbing certainly recall classic sword-n-sandal films like spartacus , but gladiator starts to drag a bit whenever derek jacobi's plotting senator is on screen . perhaps it's just that gladiator is so invigorating as a stripped-down , nuts-and-bolts dramatic adventure that anything remotely resembling subtext just gets in the way . it's even more silly than amusing to contemplate parallels between gladiator's crowd-pleasing bloodsports and professional wrestling ( complete with maximus's combat moniker "" the spaniard "" ) . the usual caveat for summer event films has been something akin to "" leave your brain at the door , "" but that's not entirely appropriate or fair to apply to gladiator ; it's too smartly scripted in its old-fashioned way . the better suggestion is to leave your expectations of hipness , reflexivity and big-budget bombast at the door . gladiator is just entertaining . . . in all the wonderful ways that word can be a good thing . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .",SRe

"unfortunately , that controversy is almost more compelling than the film itself , which proves that hero worship and drama can make uncomfortable companions . though violent and destructive , the program eventually brings the british to the bargaining table , but the result could be even more violent and destructive .

"in my review of john sayles' 1996 film lone star , i wrote that my initial frustration with the film must have meant that i missed something . such was my confidence in sayles' storytelling that i was convinced i could find the unifying thematic thread if i just pondered long enough . in that particular case , i was right . sayles' new film limbo presented me with the same initial frustration , and the same determination to find the one piece that would turn the merely intriguing into the truly brilliant . and it just wasn't there . for the first hour , there are plenty of reasons to believe limbo could be the latest thematically rich cinematic sayles novel . here , alaska has at least two faces : the raw , blank-slate wilderness that provides escape and opportunity for new beginnings , and the tourist attraction that provides a sanitized version of that wilderness . sayles offers plenty of local color with his supporting characters , but it's the way those characters interact with the place that gives limbo weight . for half the film , limbo sets a tentative romance against a backdrop of civilization trying to claim one of the few remaining frontiers , even as residents who should know better keep searching for a predictability that just isn't there . i suppose you could see the second half as sayles' attempt to show just how far civilization has to go , if you were feeling particularly generous . even worse , the links to the first half's portrait of alaska at a cultural crossroads become tenuous at best . the second half is solid enough , but it's a jarring shift . instead of a novel , sayles has written two short stories slammed together in an uncomfortable fit . john sayles' films are always comparative pleasures in the bigger picture of filmmaking , with their smart dialogue and attention to human detail . sayles has also become a more visually interesting director with every film , turning in at least one hypnotically beautiful sequence of joe returning to fishing ( another triumph for cinematographer haskell wexler ) . he can say fascinating things both with his dialogue and his camera . in limbo , all those fascinating things just don't add up to a fascinating , unified story . limbo isn't a disappointment because he doesn't say enough , as in the ambiguous final shot . it's a disappointment because he tries to say too much . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .",SRe
"despite being an inferior remake , village of the damned is the most frightening motion picture that john carpenter has brought to the screen in at least a decade . following this year's disappointing in the mouth of madness , carpenter has turned to a creepy 1960 english film for inspiration . adding more than a dose of modernization , a new setting ( the british village has become an american town ) , and a dash of his trademark shock tactics , the director has turned out an enjoyable , if obviously-flawed , amalgamation of horror and science fiction . but as the children grow , it becomes clear that there's something inhuman about them . with their platinum-blond hair and blank expressions , not only do they look unlike the men and women raising them , but they lack emotion and possess the ability to read and control minds . for a movie that opens with so much promise , village of the damned is actually something of a disappointment . the second half isn't as well-paced or intelligently scripted as what precedes it , although the taut climax will hold an interested viewer on seat's edge . as the director has shown many times before ( most notably in halloween ) , he can take an overused scene or device and infuse it with unexpected energy . this skill--and little else--keeps village of the damned entertaining throughout , but the movie is by no means an unqualified success . it's an unsettling consideration . alas , carpenter's exploration is somewhat perfunctory . ultimately , the film is more interested in surface shocks than this sort of deeper psychological horror , but vestiges of the theme still manage to lend a chilling tone to what's on screen . the cast is interesting , if not top notch . christopher reeve is adequate in a role that doesn't require a stretch of his limited dramatic range . kirstie alley displays little presence or charisma as the cold-hearted , secretive epidemiologist . what differentiates village of the damned from carpenter's best work is the lack of character definition . there's no one in midwich worth caring about . the high number of deaths--some of which are unexpected--leads to a certain unpredictability , but none of the murders has an impact beyond elevating the body count . the result is a movie that's as superficial as it is fun . and , while the director shows he's still very much on top of his craft , a tighter script , with fewer subplots vying for screen time , might have made for a memorable updating of the classic . instead , all we have is a passable remake .",JBe

"jessica lange is one of the most inconsistent actresses working today . from time-to-time , she blows away audiences with powerful , intense performances . and , much as lange would probably prefer movie-goers to develop amnesia regarding that particular entry on her resume , every once in a while she does work that is reminiscent of it , if only in quality . hush is one such example . lange is so bad here that she might have been fun to watch if the rest of the film wasn't such a prime example of motion picture tedium . the film opens , as many so-called "" psychological thrillers "" do , by posing as a light drama . the moment i first saw martha , i started looking for fangs . as long as she gets her way , martha is a perfectly amicable person , but when helen defies her , it's a declaration of war . hush has three very simple problems : it's incredibly dumb , it's incredibly boring , and it's incredibly predictable ( at least up to the stupefying ending ) . this film has absolutely nothing to recommend it , with the exception of a couple of nice shots of snow-covered fields and a quick glimpse of gwyneth paltrow's bare buttocks . frankly , it's embarrassing to watch a respected actress of lange's stature give a performance like this -- it's like a bad blanche dubois ( the role she played in a 1995 tv version of a streetcar named desire ) . meanwhile , paltrow does her best to get through her dialogue without gaping at the stupidity of some of her lines , and schaech attempts a passable imitation of an inanimate object . as in all psychological thrillers , the battle lines are clearly drawn . of course , since schaech's character is poorly-developed and badly acted , it's impossible to say how he feels about being in that situation . maybe someone should ask him if he's familiar with oedipus . she smokes cigarettes and drinks hard liquor -- two sure signs that the devil is at work . that's about it for character development . beyond that point , hush is just a series of increasingly hard-to-swallow coincidences , contrivances , and moronic plot twists . however , the first 85 minutes are just a warm-up for the ending , which is as anticlimactic as it is profoundly dissatisfying . i can't imagine anyone , no matter what they thought of the movie as a whole , liking this conclusion . either there was some serious last-minute editing or someone left out a few pages of the script . before the climax , i disliked hush ; by the time the end credits started , i hated it . viewers invest something in every movie they watch , no matter how good or bad it is . cheating them like this is offensive and unpardonable . most entries into this worn-out , worm-eaten genre aren't especially good . films like consenting adults , the hand that rocks the cradle , and single white female rely on stock plots and predictable twists to propel the narrative along . in general , however , they're directed with a degree of competence that assures a level of sustained tension . that's not the case with really bad thrillers like this , which fail to generate even a momentary heart palpitation -- the characters are too bland and the plot is too uninvolving for anyone in the audience to care . indeed , the title of this movie probably refers to what the producers hope viewers will do in lieu of telling their friends what they really think of this sorry piece of celluloid .

"the stupids is a pleasant surprise : a comedy about dumb characters that doesn't insult the audience's intelligence . unlike such recent offerings as dumb and dumber , the brady bunch movie , and kingpin , john landis' brand of humor doesn't rely on flatulence jokes , double entendres , or sexual innuendo . the stupids is relatively clean , entirely suitable for family viewing , and much funnier than countless films with harsher mpaa ratings . brent forrester's script is a machiavellian masterpiece of misdirection , misrepresentation , and mayhem . and be forewarned -- appearances can be deceiving . despite the title , this film is going to appeal more to the thinking viewer than someone who prefers to sit back and laugh at mindless gags . the best aspect of the stupids is seeing events from two perspectives -- that of a "" normal "" person and that of our intrepid heroes , a family so dense that , put together , their combined iqs would have trouble reaching the triple-digit level . with a vacuous affability , tom arnold plays stanley stupid , the good-natured head of the stupid clan . joan looks like she just stepped out of an episode of leave it to beaver . unlike in the past , however , he's no longer going to sit back and allow this sort of thing to continue . someone is draining the world of one of its most valuable resources : garbage . done in a style that recalls the tv series spoof get smart , the stupids is more likely to provoke chuckles than uncontrollable bursts of laughter , but the wit involved in constructing this screwball comedy is undeniable . even at a slim ninety minutes , the running length is probably a little too long , but , for the most part , the stupids is fresh and energetic . stupid humor like this requires a smart audience , and it's probably necessary to be a member of mensa to untangle all the relationships revealed in stanley's wacky musical number , "" i'm my own grandpaw . "" director john landis ( the blues brothers , amazon women on the moon ) , who has never been one to make conventional movies , manages to inject several viciously satirical sequences into the film . the stupids pokes fun at action movie heroes ( and does so in a far more effective manner than arnold schwarzenegger's bloated last action hero ) , late night tv talk shows , and afternoon tabloid programs . there's a delicious fantasy sequence with christopher lee playing the stupids' vision of sender . and there are cameos by film makers david cronenberg , atom egoyan , robert wise , and norman jewison , as well as centerfold- turned-personality jenny mccarthy . the stupids is loaded ( if not overloaded ) with all sorts of humor - - everything from satire and wordplay to slapstick . not a moment goes by when something amusing isn't happening , even if it's taking place in the background ( for example , when stanley outlines sender's plan , take a look at the notes in the margins of his master diagram ) . the stupids will be seen in different ways by different people , but one thing is abundantly clear : the film makers deserve congratulations for coming up with something this diabolically clever .",JBe
"warning : spoiler in the next paragraph . the film ends with a long kiss between the japanese-american detective and the white artist , making a loud statement that it's fine that the heroine prefers someone of a different race . it's a satisfactory fuller work , that is lurid while also reflective of the racial divide in the country . in his gritty way , fuller hammers home the point of the need for racial tolerance and that there's urban alienation out there to deal with . the problem with the film , is that the mystery story was never developed and seems included as just an afterthought .",DSc
"i am sorry to report that tim burton has decided to make a third batman movie , batman forever . this is the first one that he did not direct although he did produce it . for director he tapped joel schumacher , whose only halfway decent film was the client . this time we have chris o'donnell playing dick grayson - robin . the plot , you ask ? why do you ask ? if you have seen one batman , you have seen them all . i will not cover the plot as its existence is irrelevant . one sees batman to sneer at the villains and watch all of the gadgetry and stunts . almost every scene requires the suspension of disbelief in order to watch it . the script is full of one liners that end in "" ha ha ha "" just to make sure that you know it is supposed to be a joke . moreover , the director has the actors get all wild eyed to make absolutely sure you know it is a joke . perhaps , batman has always been this way , but the style has outlined ability to charm or interest an audience . the audience in the theater i was at had about as much interest in the movie as val kilmer did , which is almost none . he sleepwalked through most of the movie . even at that , his performance was much better than kidman's who was unable to demonstrate she could act at all , and based on her previous movies , i would say the jury is still out on that question anyway . the sets by barbara ling and the cinematography by stephen goldblatt were in the usual dark and foreboding batman style . granted they were not as sinister as in batman or batman returns , nevertheless , they were pretty depressing . i understand that robin williams was offered the role of the riddler , but tim burton got frustrated when williams would not make up his mind if he wanted to take the part or not and gave it to carrey instead out of frustration . frankly , i think williams's style of humor would have enlivened the show some , and i am sorry he did not agree to do the part . batman forever seemed liked it ran forever . the editing by dennis virkler was fast paced , but had too much material at 2 : 00 . i was bored from the beginning . it is correctly rated pg-13 for comic violence and sexual references . i would not let kids under 13 see it , but there were a fair number of 8 year olds and above in the audience when i saw it . i do not recommend the movie , and i award it a single star solely for the gadgets . i hope tim burton realizes that the batman formula is tired , and it is time to bury it . i do hope that next year we do not have batman ad nauseam as yet another blockbuster attempt .",SRh
"date released : 4/23/93 running length : 1 : 42 rated : pg-13 ( mature themes , sexual situations , language ) of course , there are various interpersonal dramas that have to be resolved . there are some pretty good laughs in this film . one hilarious sequence involves sam raimi ( the director of such films as the evil dead series ) attempting to transfer baggage from a canoe to a dock . both of these instances , as well as a few others , had the entire audience in stitches . unfortunately , the good-but-uneven sense of comedy and some excellent performances cannot camouflage the shallowness of the plot , the ineptness of the direction , and the pitifully juvenile dialogue . this movie desperately needed someone competent to take control , and writer/director mike binder is clearly not that person . someone in high school could have crafted better lines for the characters , and binder is obsessed with close-ups . he too often uses them in the most inappropriate of places , diluting tension and weakening interaction between the actors . the story is simplistic and the character conflict weak . there isn't an original moment in the film . coming-of-age stories have been done so often that for one to make an impression , it needs to find a new angle ( peter's friends , ken branagh's recent film , although clearly superior to this production , fell into the same trap--little that's new ) . the ensemble cast does a marvelous job from top to bottom . alan arkin , the consummate professional , is wonderfully dry as director of the camp . kevin pollak puts his wit to good use , although his one-theme jokes become tiresome after a while . sam raimi , not known for his acting , gives a credible performance as the glassy-eyed , inept stick . the actors are so good , in fact , that despite being given paper-thin characters and embarrassing lines , they almost pull it off . now and then , i found indian summer drawing me in simply because these performers are nearly perfect . all of them have been in good projects in the past and doubtless we will be graced by additional fine performances in the future . if there's a reason to see indian summer , and it's a very slim one indeed , it's to see the cast . obviously there's a lot of nostalgia involved for him , but he fails to get it across to the audience . cheap cinematography tricks like graying out the film won't suddenly cause the audience to wax sentimental . binder fails in both the directing and writing fronts and if he hadn't chosen such an exemplary cast , this could have been a real disaster . as it is , indian summer is just a singularly unremarkable and uninteresting movie .",JBe
"screenplay : guy ritchie . director : guy ritchie . it's tough to knock a film as undeniably invigorating as lock , stock and two smoking barrels without coming off as an impossible-to-please crank . yes , it's generally funny , clever and unpredictable ; true , it's plotted with a precision that should make aspiring screenwriters take notes ; indeed , it has visual style to spare . guy ritchie's caper/comedy/thriller has a savage entertainment value that's awfully hard to find anymore . it's also a film without an ounce of humanity , a narrative machine where the fun feels hollow because the characters come with names and virtually nothing more . that's a problem that really only nags in hindsight , since you'll spend all your viewing time just trying to keep up . believe it or not , that's the simple part of the multi-layered plotting in lock , stock and two smoking barrels . there are plenty of occasions during the first half of the film when it feels over-populated , over-plotted and over-directed , sending situations , vertiginous camera angles and new faces at the audience in overwhelming waves . only ritchie's appealing wit might keep you from throwing up your hands and throwing in the towel . fortunately , the second and third acts offer so much propulsive action that forgiveness for the early excesses becomes fairly easy . ritchie manages to pull all these threads together quite deftly , creating a series of confrontations which continuously whip up new permutations of violence , dark humor and surprise . there are missteps here as well -- including a depiction of the protagonists' celebrating an apparent victory which resembles a drinking binge by the monkees -- but the caper itself is engrossing enough to help hide them . lock , stock and two smoking barrels blindsides you with its sheer momentum , the pieces falling into place so rapidly that you can't help but admire ritchie's audacity . it's considerably harder to admire his thoroughgoing lack of interest in his characters except as gun-toting props . every bit of color in the film's performances comes from the use of physical types -- the bald , imposing barry ; the short , high-strung rory ; strapping but soft-spoken big chris . quentin tarantino often is credited with inspiring a slew of nihilistic comic-crime imitators , but tarantino's way with actors and redemption-hungry characters has always given him away as a closet humanist , and has always tempered his infamous violent streak . you can't knock a director in 1999 who at least makes you want to watch . you just wish this rowdy bit of entertainment made you want to care about something , anything , besides how many bodies will pile up before the credits roll . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .",SRe
"there isn't much of a plot , and what there is isn't that important . it is simply a frame within which to explore the culture of some vibrant spanish gypsies . in fact , the actual "" talkie "" scenes almost become too much of a distraction from the rich portrayal of the community . in between are moments with those in charge of the caravacas family , building a slow , poignant path to revenge . luckily the plot development is repetitively simple so that all of the characters have room to be sympathetic . there isn't an annoying "" good and evil "" perspective placed on the viewer . this film is not about picking sides in an argument or making morality calls . but the music and dancing are the key roles in vengo . between the variety shown and the pride taken in skill and passing down of tradition , it's easy to become mesmerized with the culture . a nice added touch is that men take as much pride as women in being able to evoke physical grace . and though the dancing does have a sexually alluring quality , it is not the reason for participation . it can be difficult to grasp the lyrics because they are only partially subtitled . this is unfortunate for outsiders who know little about gypsy life because it's impossible to guess at the inspiration for such emoting performances . at least the emotional expression of the singers provides an easily sympathetic intensity that evokes an understanding about how attached the music is to tradition . gatlif has managed to utilize an old , almost boring , plot structure to respectfully portray a culture much overlooked . he obviously loved his subject and the way in which it was filmed provides a contagious appreciation for a people often misunderstood .",DSc
"this disney presentation of a time travel fantasy tale has the good sense not to try and spend too much time clearing up what theoretical scientists say is impossible : it is not possible to go back to the past and change history . "" the kid "" is a children's story but is stretched into an adult one as well . it is usually through dreams , drugs , one's creative work , psychoanalysis , or meditation that one looks back at their past , but bruce is too blocked for any of that . if one were to overlook all the impossibilities about this story and just concentrate on how the bruce willis character comes to resolve his problem , then the film is somewhat engaging . though , it is sad to say that he resolves his problem the typical macho way , by beating up his nemesis . the movie was ably directed by jon turtletaub ( while you were sleeping/phenomenon ) and written by audrey wells ( the truth about cats and dogs ) . it has a balanced mixture of adult sentimentalities and childish comedy that should bring both children and adults into the same movie theater , each finding something in the film to experience together . the idea of the film is intriguing , of a man who will live his future as he knows he should because he got to the bottom of what troubled him when he was growing up , and though the story is impossible and the self-absorbed bruce is now learning to be nice to those close to him that he has hurt before , seemed like a stretch , it is still a family-fare film with a few more ideas thrown in than the usual disney flicks . though this type of supernatural movie has been tried often ( back to the future/frequency/12 monkeys ) , this film had a nice quality to it , making it rather special . bruce willis works very well with children , he seems to be a natural , and all his previous films with children also attest to this , including his recent supernatural thriller "" the sixth sense .

"art biopics are rarely successful ventures but this film approaches those high caliber art films , such as jacques rivette's la belle noiseuse and paul cox's vincent : the life and death of vincent van gogh , but falls short by a good country mile due to the film's inability to get a handle on how to tell about the taciturn artist's inner demons in a significant way rather than in the traditional bleak and trite way hollywood films usually illustrate an artist's failings . the strength of the film is in the tour de force performances of both ed harris as the action painter pollock , a role that he is well-suited to play , and marcia gay harden's understated but brilliant performance as his brooklyn-born wife and main supporter , lee krasner . she won the oscar for best supporting actress , in a lengthy role where she was actually the co-star . but this is ed harris's film , a film he wanted to do as long as 15 years ago after reading a book about pollock and noticing from a photo how closely he resembled him and how he had a certain vibe for him . he not only directs and stars in the film , but he financed it . these scenes were brilliantly executed by harris and made the film a labor of love for him . harris was absolutely convincing playing the artist , he looked as if he was a real artist at work . pollock is not an overwhelming film , as much as it is a superbly well acted one . it shows how pollock found freedom only when he painted , as his outside life was that of a flawed man , a very difficult man to get along with , who didn't have much to say about art or life that was particularly interesting . harris as a director , had a love affair with the artist that was much too respectful to get beyond what we already know about him . he was someone who lived out the artist fantasy trip by achieving more in style than in substance , even though the film wants us to believe he was truly a great artist .",DSc
"of the possible old television series to remake , "" the mod squad "" has to be one of the least promising . although it was one of my favorites from back in the late 1960s and early 1970s , its charm was highly tied to the era . rather than update the series , scott silver's the mod squad is merely a recast version . with less material than in one of the old episodes , the feature film script by stephen t . kay and silver is so thin it feels like an executive summary that you might present to potential financial film backers . figuring that today's generation not only hasn't seen the series , they don't even know what "" mod "" means , the introductory credits feature its dictionary entry . perhaps the confusing and convoluted storyline would have been helped by explanatory subtitles , but , since you're unlikely to care , it doesn't really matter . her intelligence enlivens a role that's little better than a stick figure . none of the characters have any depth , and the director doesn't come up with a single fresh scene in the entire movie . weakest of all is omar epps as linc , who was the best character in the old show . epps's inert acting makes his character less than two-dimensional . the time period for the movie is relatively indeterminate as the cars and sets are a mixture of stuff from the 1970s and the 1990s . cinematographer ellen kuras creates an exceedingly ugly picture , whose dark , grainy images make it look like it was filmed on cheap videotape and then later transferred to film stock . the film's jarring music by b . c . smith is full of bongo drums and a jazz beat in the style , perhaps , of the original , but it feels heavily dated and awkward today . yes , julie does get to say her signature "" right on !

"inevitably , someone is going to ask me why i subjected myself to this experience , and the only excuse i can think of is that i'm trying to populate my "" bottom 10 of 1997 "" list . in any given year , the january-april period is traditionally a time when all sorts of bad movies are released . so far , 1997 has been a bonanza in that department . in just over four weeks , i've seen enough cinematic rubbish to overflow my mental recycling bin . and now , having sat through the pest , i may have already found my worst movie of the year . judging by the first weekend's abysmal box office total , his jump fell considerably short -- right into the inky pit of oblivion , in fact . by the time you read this review , it may be difficult to locate the movie in a theater - - not that you'd want to . the only reason this film might last beyond seven days is if there's a contractual obligation to be met . it's mind-boggling to consider that movies this bad are actually committed to film . the poor quality of the pest in almost every category -- humor , intelligence , creativity , and just plain entertainment value -- ranks it somewhere between a bad infomercial and a local cable newscast . rarely do i consider the act of seeing a movie to be a chore , but this kind of experience is the exception . at least i have the consolation of recognizing that watching something like this will enable me to appreciate even a mediocre motion picture .

"it is hard for me to believe that one of the world's greatest directors and one of my favorites , paul cox ( lonely hearts/my first wife/man of flowers/cactus/a woman's tale ) , made a film that was so saintly that it seemed to be without dramatic affect or chinks in its pious armor . this is not a commercial film , nor one that tends to compromise its serious tone in order to become more entertaining . it is a true story that tries not to flinch from the suffering it presents and from the altruistic virtues of the dedicated priest who is only interested in comforting those shunned by society because of leprosy . it eschews the tricks of filmmaking in its presentation of such a morbid subject , to its detriment . there is no bend in this film . in this beautifully shot film on the island of kalaupapahe , catching the lushness of the hawaiian islands , cox has taken the subject matter of suffering to a new degree of intensity and requires the viewer to be either fully absorbed in it or else it would be impossible to feel anything about such a miserable topic as 19th century leprosy ( hansen's disease ) . there is medicine for treating leprosy as of 1940 , but the undeveloped countries still can't afford that medicine , so the disease is still around . and as brilliant a study as this is , taking on such a difficult subject , this brilliance fails to amount to anything more than being a history lesson about hawaii and about those banished to die alone from that disease on an abandoned hawaiian island called molokai . he is so touched by this , that the first leper he sees , who is a child , he not only touches but embraces . unfortunately , the storytelling remains flat despite the superb character performance by the australian david wenham . in one scene , the most dramatic one in the film , lepers are tossed off the boat docked on the island's harbor and many of them drown . it is a scene of immense cruelty , but seems to have happened as if it were a dream and not real , as not much is made of it and the film just continues on without giving pause to that event . the film just couldn't say more about the priest except that he made conditions better , converted many to catholicism , and contacted the disease and died , relieved to know that the nuns have come at last and that there is another priest to carry on the work . these are fine accomplishments , but i'm afraid , they are not dramatic enough to energize this film . i felt anguished about all the piety i was seeing , but the film despite all its obvious flaws lingered with me for a long time afterwards and i'm not quite sure why . that is why i liked it better when the film had a chance to sink in , than i did when first watching it . it's a tough film to enjoy and i'm not sure i learned anything about suffering from it , that is if i was supposed to , but i do think i saw someone who i believe is an actual saint , and he was a spellbinding saintly figure despite being so unapproachable . it was the very best thing i have to say about a tedious film that i am glad i saw , even if i was not entertained by it .",DSc

"but , unlike films that live or die on the basis of unexpected plot disclosures , secrets are only important to the locusts in the way they define the characters , explain their motivations , and drive their actions . it's entirely possible to guess one ( or more ) of the truths that these men and women keep buried before those revelations are explicitly divulged , but such insight is unlikely to diminish your appreciation of this film in any significant way . in fact , it may actually enhance it . the locusts is a genuinely powerful motion picture that achieves its potency through character development rather than audience manipulation . this approach is becoming increasingly rare in dramatic motion pictures , which often try too hard to generate tears , and it speaks highly of first time feature director john patrick kelly's ability to tell a story . the locusts is also successful in the way it manages to interweave small moments of triumph with intimate tragedies . this is not by any means a "" feel good "" motion picture ( quite the opposite , in fact ) , but there are times when it touches a core of optimism . writer/director kelly has chosen a strong cast to work with . vince vaughn , who made his mark in swingers before appearing in the lost world , gives his strongest performance to date -- an intelligent and believable rendering of a man trapped by powerful emotional forces . kate capshaw , best known as either mrs . steven spielberg or "" the girl from the second indiana jones movie "" , renders mrs . potts with the intensity and style of a femme fatale -- sexy , mysterious , and dangerous . the most striking performance , however , belongs to jeremy davies ( spanking the monkey ) , whose interpretation of flyboy is worthy of mention alongside that of dustin hoffman from rain man , tom hanks from forrest gump , billy bob thornton from sling blade , and geoffrey rush from shine . the locusts is as rich in themes as it is in three-dimensional characters . there's atonement , redemption , revenge , and a particularly brutal examination of the shifting balance of power between men and women , and parents and children . but the one with the darkest motivation is mrs . potts , who makes no excuse for her savagery and the manner in which she abuses every kind of power at her disposal . the narrative for the locusts does justice to each of these motifs as it gradually peels back the onion-like layers of the characters to reveal the complexity that lies beneath . the film doesn't offer any simpleminded solutions to difficult issues , and there are two very different ways to interpret the ending ( depending on whether you're an optimist or a pessimist ) . the locusts explores both extremes of the human experience -- the purity of innocence and the viciousness of cruelty -- as well as many of the ambiguous shades in between . if there's one misstep in the locusts , it's that the meaning of the title ( which is a metaphor ) is explained a little too obviously . but that's an extremely minor quibble and it does little to detract from the strength of this film , which is one of the year's best .

"there have been any number of vietnam tales--oliver stone has made a career out of that time and place--but none with quite the perspective of the hughes brothers' . sometimes , however , good intentions and a valiant effort aren't enough . in detailing one man's actions and their consequences , dead presidents isn't just an african american tragedy -- its impact is universal . although dead presidents isn't as intense or wrenching as the hughes brothers' debut feature , menace ii society , the scope is different . dead presidents is also somewhat different from most of the vast number of cinematic vietnam experiences because its focus is on how the overseas trauma contributes to the reconstruction of a man's character . dead presidents isn't awash in originality , but its black perspective hasn't yet been overdone , and the hughes brothers' add their unique imprint to the narrative . his role here requires greater range ( although less intensity ) , and he carries it off with aplomb . tucker's work is noteworthy , as he manages to provide a fair amount of comic relief without compromising the viability of his character . even though dead presidents is more about the effects of poverty than those of racism , only the most naive viewer could completely dissociate the two . nevertheless , the hughes brothers don't overtly introduce race as an issue . instead , this is about the failure of society , and how desperation , more than greed , can lead to radical and violent acts . the film is not perfect--certain sequences are awkward or drawn from stock , and many of the supporting characters are stereotypes--but solid storytelling and tight pacing push dead presidents through its weak spots . the result not only reaffirms the hughes brothers' ability as film makers , but shows they can go beyond the limits of the urban street drama they presented so forcefully in menace ii society .",JBe

"" - kenneth branagh , director of mary shelly's frankenstein during the course of more than thirty adaptations , sequels , spin- offs , rip-offs , and spoofs , the name of "" frankenstein "" has become associated with one of the world's most recognizable movie monsters . rarely , however , has a cinematic interpretation of "" the daemon "" approached the level of three-dimensionality with which it is portrayed in the novel . as conceived and written by shelly , frankenstein was more of a gothic melodrama than a horror story . for the most part , however , motion pictures have chosen to ignore the weightier issues of the book to concentrate instead on the "" monster movie "" aspects . with this latest cinematic depiction , director ( and uncredited co-writer ) kenneth branagh has taken a less-traveled path . what branagh should recognize better than anyone , though , is that tragedy is at its most effective when allowed to cook slowly , basting in its own juices . this version of frankenstein moves so frantically that far too many subtleties get lost along the way . the result is a rousing , occasionally-chaotic ( especially during the choppily-edited first half-hour ) piece of work that , while undeniably entertaining , lacks a depth that might otherwise have been attained . patrick doyle's bombastic score helps only to underline the melodramatic elements of this production , rarely allowing a quiet or reflective moment . as far as its faithfulness to the source material is concerned , mary shelly's frankenstein frequently differs from the book on plot points , but the two are thematically in synch . surprisingly enough , although it reflects nothing written by shelly , this scene is effective in underlining the weaknesses and strengths of both victor frankenstein and his creature . the greatest strength of mary shelly's frankenstein is that it illustrates both the good and evil qualities in each of its main characters . of the two--robert de niro's creature and kenneth branagh's frankenstein--the former is , perhaps surprisingly , the more sympathetic . in part because of the script and in part because of the acting ( de niro gives a stronger performance than his director/co-star ) , the creature seems almost the more "" human "" of the two . in its own words , it is capable of great love and great rage . despite the presence of john cleese--who is excellent in a straight , if somewhat limited , role--there is no comic relief in mary shelly's frankenstein ( or at least none that is intentional--a few lines here and there are too-obviously overacted , which can lead to a chuckle or two ) . however , since the screenplay is not relentlessly downbeat , the bursts of action and horror are effective enough in lessening tension that breaks of levity are not needed . in fact , given the tone of this film , humor might easily have seemed an unwelcome intrusion . shelly was never concerned about the scientific realism of frankenstein's actions . in this film , while branagh doesn't attempt to fully remedy this lapse ( something that obviously can't be done ) , he presents enough pseudo- scientific evidence to suggest how the creation of a life might plausibly be accomplished . suspension of disbelief is , of course , requisite for the viewer at this point . one area where this frankenstein meets expectations is in its cast . the weakest link is branagh ( and that's not to suggest that he gives a bad performance , because he doesn't ) , whose victor is more than occasionally overwrought . de niro , although buried beneath hours' worth of makeup , is less monstrous here than in films like cape fear and the untouchables . helena bonham carter gives a feisty and fiery interpretation of elizabeth , who eventually becomes much more than merely frankenstein's love interest . the film has a striking visual look , which owes as much to the set design and special effects as to the soaring cinematography of roger pratt . although branagh does not opt for straight horror , the gothic element of the tale is very much in evidence as a result of the carefully-crafted atmosphere of several key scenes . considering the merits of both movies , however , there is little doubt which is more effective . kenneth branagh's film is stronger thematically and visually , possesses more solid characterization , and boasts robert de niro and helena bonham carter rather than keanu reeves and winona ryder . mary shelly's frankenstein may not be the definitive version of the 1817 novel , and the director likely attempted more than is practical for a two-hour film , but overambition is preferable to the alternative , especially if it results--as in this case--in something more substantial than hollywood's typical , fitfully entertaining fluff .",JBe

"" that's why brosnan , mgm and the estate of ian fleming can rest easy that there will always be a market for their films , the tom cruises of the world be hanged . there's enough furiously paced woo action in the final forty minutes to keep mission : impossible 2 from crashing and burning ; there's just not enough to make it anything special , nor enough depth to the story to fill in the blanks between chases . anyone who's followed woo's career knows he's better than this material , but maybe there's only so much even a gifted film-maker can do with a product that's first and foremost about a brand name . the name on the director's chair can only get in the way . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .",SRe

"" when it comes to genre film-making , there's an easy way to get the audience to respond the way you want them to respond , and there's the way writer/director stephen sommers chooses to craft his remake of the mummy . rarely has a film exterted so much narrative effort to say so little . unlike the 1932 original , this version is more action-adventure than horror , focusing on derring-do over scaring-do . it certainly delivers its share of fight sequences ; some of them are even fairly rousing , combining unique visual effects with narrow escapes and a dose of visual humor . the echoes of raiders of the lost ark are obvious , but the mummy may actually owe an equal debt to sam raimi's army of darkness in its attempts at supernatural slapstick . though nowhere near the level of the "" indiana jones "" films -- and indeed , not even necessarily at the level of army of darkness -- the mummy at times manages to deliver the goods . the goals of a film like the mummy should be fairly simple , yet sommers manages to miss the point entirely over and over again . the plot summary above doesn't do remote justice to the sacks of exposition , extraneous plot threads and go-nowhere characters with which the mummy is burdened . the film takes forever to set up the premise , with the exploration party finally reaching hamunaptra at about the one hour mark . there's no economy to the mummy , no understanding of how to create a solid hero , a solid villain and a solid conflict and let the action roll . it would be easy enough to snipe at the dopey dialogue and silly performances in the mummy -- i'm still waiting for someone to convince me that brendan fraser has leading-man charm -- especially since it would deserve every snipe . there are a few clever touches , but mostly sommers seems to show the typical blockbuster disdain for characters and situations which do anything more than set up the next effects shot . yet such complaints miss the point that the mummy isn't even a good brainless action film with its lumbering pacing . all the jaw-dropping visual trickery in the world doesn't help if a film wanders around in circles before pulling out its "" a "" material . groan if you must , but the mummy needed to be wrapped up much more tightly . the mummy , horror picture . . . what do you need , a road map ? see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .",SRe

"quite a few recent north american imports of australian films have been mediocre , feel-good comedies like hotel de love , cosi , and love and other catastrophes . children of the revolution , the latest offering from down under , is superior to its tepid '97 predecessors in several ways . not only is it based on a fairly original premise , but the humor exhibits a distinct edge . the film starts out much like strictly ballroom , with a faux documentary format that lapses into a more traditional narrative version of storytelling . this style persists throughout the entire film , with talking head commentary and "" archival footage "" occasionally interrupting the flow . the most biting wit comes during these "" interviews , "" and first-time writer/director peter duncan's atypical approach allows the movie to end with a recursive twist . smartly written and adroitly developed , children of the revolution fires verbal and visual volleys at multiple bullseyes , from communism and stalin to the news media and mcdonalds . not all of the satirical jabs hit their mark , but there are so many of them that most of the misses go unnoticed . and several that do work are just short of brilliant . one of the more absurd scenes , which calls to mind mel brooks' "" springtime for hitler "" ( from the producers ) , has stalin singing and dancing to "" i get a kick out of you "" . there's also a sequence that details a "" macabre and barbaric "" means of breaking a hunger strike : blow the scent of sizzling bacon into the cell of the striking prisoner . one testament to the strength of duncan's film is the cast he was able to assemble . international star judy davis is in fine form as joan . if there's an obvious fault with children of the revolution , it's that there's very little subtlety . some of the satire is broader than seems necessary . nevertheless , there's enough solidly entertaining , occasionally thought-provoking material in the film to make it worth a trip to the theater . the barbs directed at the manner in which the media disseminates information , while not as vicious as those delivered by gus van sant's to die for , are among the movie's strengths , and the aspects of political parody are universally comprehensible . children of the revolution uses a fresh approach to take aim at a broad range of targets , and the result is both decisive and incisive .",JBe
"this is a steven spielberg dreamworks project film . her unattentive folks don't even realize what is eating at her , that she wants an unneeded breast enlargement , and that she lacks self-esteem , thinking of herself as being unattractive . ricky and lester will share this same vision of life , as this becomes the film's mantra , reinforced several times throughout the film : that redemption can be gotten through love . this mantra will also be repeated at the end of the film , before the credits are shown . the viewer is told by lester , from the other world : that if you don't share the film's piercing vision of what really matters , someday you will . the lesson to be learnt is , that love is the only thing that can't be completely taken away from people ; it remains behind everything that is . this alan ball script , his debut assignment in films , is bristling with comedy and hard lessons to learn about life for these unfulfilled characters . if normalcy is the thing that the families are striving for , even if that is quickly seen as a sham , then what the director brilliantly does , is shoot down any hope for his characters ever being normal , even those who might think that they are normal . so what are they striving for , if not normalcy ? what results is a darkly satirical story that was equisitively directed . it makes sound points about the fallacy of normalcy and the necessity of nonconformity , and that its barbs about suburbia are on target . but the film succeeds , and in some regards is brilliant , not because some of the flawed characters see the light of day at last and might possibly reform , but because the acting was grand by everyone , and spacey was more than grand , his was a tour-de-force performance . he has the ability to squeeze humor out of a stone and turn frightening at the drop of a dish . he's that good of an actor to carry this film , even as he is supported by a terrific cast , he still stands out as the star . bening is his perfect foil , with a special flare for comedy , but still , through no fault of hers , is a cardboard villain , with no room to grow . mena is in an exploitive role , one that calls for an obligatory porn shot of her breasts ; but she is delicious and appealing , and brings more to the part than can be expected , even crying out for sympathy by the film's end . thora , a 17-year-old veteran actress , even at that tender age , played a twisted and sullen figure , but nevertheless came off as a sympathetic figure , giving a soulful performance , in a role that reminded many people of one that christina ricci would play , but not necessarily play better . cooper did a fine job as a homophobic and a closet homosexual , but his role as a villain was also too one-dimensional to give his character a more introspective edge to it , even if his performance was first-class . so why did i just like the film very much but not love it ? i think it is because , as entertaining as this film was , something just didn't smell right about these roses ; everything discovered seemed to be only something that is surface ; there was no real revolution of character going on . i think there were too many contradictions in the lives of lester , ricky , and jane to believe that they found what they were looking for , even if , the film implies that is just what they did do . the satire also became mean-spirited , at this point , as i took exception to some of the jokes plied from these scenes , as they seemed to be mocking those who take such jobs , by implying those jobs are just for losers . his character was actually the most interesting one in the film , since he saw things the others couldn't see , yet i suspect there is something deeply wrong with a teenager who has to find love by being a voyeur and material success by being a drug dealer , no matter how it is explained away . when you think about what the film had to say and distance yourself from all the fine performances and the splendid cinematography that the 70-ish-year-old master of his craft , conrad l . hall , gave us , who is an expert on lighting techniques , and you step away from the sharp wit found in alan ball's dazzling script-- what you are left wondering about , is how shallow it all is , in a film that has a bite to its satire but not enough of a bite to dig into the characters other than what is seen on the surface . in the end , this is primarily a hollywood type of film and all the hype about how daring and nonconventional this film is , should be dismissed as nothing but hype . yet it is a captivating film , one that had its moments of grandeur , and all-in-all , i really was absorbed in it , and somehow liked the film more than i probably should have .",DSc

"documentaries work best when they challenge your assumptions and make you think . dutch director johan van der keuken's i ( heart ) $ is a provocative film with an obviously anti-capitalist agenda . the film is mesmerizing because it keeps you on your toes . sandwiched between reasonable arguments are a host of illogical ones and "" facts , "" which are clearly anything but . made in 1986 and rarely shown in this country , the story is structured as a series of interviews with people , rich and poor . this first segment implants in our subconscious that people make money mainly to manipulate those less fortunate . although it isn't clear , since the film doesn't contain any chapter headings , the next sequence is set in new york city . at first , as we drive by buildings in ruins , we think we are passing through a war zone . this continues the theme of the rich exploiting the poor , and this time it suggests that they do it illegally without ever being caught . the third sequence has an american banker explaining his economic theories . the only benefit of having money that he can think of is to use it to make more money . moreover factory utilization is at an all time low , and people are investing in sexy new technologies rather than basic ones like steel . the banker argues persuasively and is unchallenged by the sympathetic interviewer , but on closer examination , you realize what absolute balderdash it all is , contrast , for example , the stagnation of the 1970s with the boom of the 1980s and 1990s . rather than complaining that the question contains a false assumption , the executive tries to answer it as politely as he can . the exasperating editing and cinematography are the movie's weakest links . long sequences of little value go on long past the time when their points have been made . the camera is sometimes pointed at the strangest places . during one interview we have a long sequences in which all we see is a curtain . we also get lots of close-ups of flowerbeds -- purpose unknown . this visual has absolutely nothing whatsoever to do with the story . adroitly and seductively presented , the film is fascinating , albeit perhaps not for the reasons the filmmaker intended . i ( heart ) $ runs too long at 2 : 25 . it is not rated but might be pg-13 for brief , partial nudity and would be fine for kids old enough to be interested , which probably means teenagers .",SRh
"would macaulay culkin fill the bill ? casting actors against type is always a risky proposition . when it works , the dividends are often huge , but when it fails , the movie usually goes under . few are less likely to play a conscienceless , nasty-minded boy than the lively culkin , and when he tries , he does a horrendous job . elijah wood , who did a solid job in disney's newest adventures of huck finn , is better than culkin--but not by much . there's something not right about mark . a few of mark's scenes ring true , but at least as many are overly-melodramatic and acted with a distinct lack of inspiration . the plot itself is rather unimpressive , telling the story of a psychotic pre-teen . there are a number of fascinating psychological issues that could have been exploited , but were left untouched in favor of presenting a straightforward thriller . for example , we get precious little motivation for henry's actions . there are a couple of throw-away lines that explain one incident , but say little about everything else . the movie makes a few futile attempts to use mark's guilt about his mother's death as a plot device , but it keeps getting in the way of the overall story . if anything , this element makes the good son even less believable than it already is . the ending of the movie is actually clever , which is a surprise given the routine conclusions to so many thrillers , but those few good minutes do not save the movie . it's far more difficult for a bad motion picture to be redeemed by a strong last scene than it is for a good film to be ruined by a dumb finale . i'm a little surprised and disappointed that director joseph ruben has turned out such a lackluster production ( although this isn't his first miss--witness sleeping with the enemy , a pedestrian movie if there ever was one ) . ruben , whose 1987 sleeper the stepfather was one of the decade's best thrillers , has , in the good son , ignored everything that made that earlier film work : a tight script , excellent atmosphere , and solid characterization . from the red-clay backdrops of nevada to the frosty winterscapes of new england , the good son is beautifully photographed ( by cinematographer john lindley ) , but that's one of its few positive points . not many people enjoy going to the movies just to see pretty nature scenes , but that's just about the only reason for taking a trip to the theaters for the good son . those expecting a good scare would do better to look elsewhere . at best , this is strictly cable fare .",JBe

"director : henry selick . if jurassic park proved one thing , it was this : image * is * everything . what the public seems to want most from movies is spectacle ; show them something they've never seen before , and they'll beat a path to the theater door , even if the story is fairly simplistic . this news should come as a great comfort to touchstone pictures and tim burton . the nightmare before christmas is a straightforward , somewhat bland fable which would have put me to sleep if done with live action or traditional hand-drawn animation . however , its stop-motion figures and incredible production design are dazzling enough to give nightmare a delightfully timeless quality which make it far more entertaining than it could have been . first , the good news : nightmare is truly unlike anything you've ever seen before . the look combines old rankin/bass christmas specials , edward gorey illustrations and the beatles' yellow submarine to create a remarkably distinctive and detailed world . the animation is incredibly fluid , to the extent that i began to wonder whether a couple of characters were real humans somehow edited into the film . it was the kind of film where i never took my eyes off the screen because i was afraid of missing something . director henry selick avoids the pitfall of "" showing off "" his toys ; he keeps the camera moving , telling the story visually with style and effectiveness , particularly jack's graveyard song after his christmas coup . the down side of this complex and expensive animation technique is that the story had to be packed into under 75 minutes . there is no time for nuance of character or well-developed motivations ; the filmmakers slam through the plot at a breakneck pace , avoiding lags in pace but also avoiding a truly engaging story . the villainous character of oogie boogie also comes up a bit short , and a slightly grumpy santa could have been very interesting . the story is a fairy tale , so i don't take issue with the simplicity of the plot . i was just disappointed with the apparent decision to throw everything into the visuals . perhaps most disappointing is the song score by frequent tim burton collaborator danny elfman . taking an operatic approach , nightmare is almost entirely through-sung , making the songs a crucial element of the film . but with the exception of the lively "" what's this ? "" during jack's discovery of christmas town , the tunes are fairly tedious and the lyrics lacking in wit . they seemed designed simply to move the story forward , not to inspire humability like the best ashman/menken tunes from the recent disney films . it's surprising given elfman's playful oingo boingo oeuvre that his songs here are so somber and uninspired . some movies are called feasts for the senses . the nightmare before christmas qualifies as a feast for the sense , singular . while there is very little worth listening to in the film , there is more than enough worth looking at to compensate , particularly for those with a slightly twisted sense of humor .",SRe
"but until then , it just seemed like a very entertaining pop culture film , whose satire comes about in comic-strip form , as it tweaks the side of sensibility in favor of perversity . but then again , it is quite possible that the film is so polemic and so full of contempt for society , that its theme revolves around the scientists surviving in a wasteland anyway they can ( maybe a referral to t . s . if that is the case and i suspect it is , then this film becomes a more sublime work than i thought at first , chewing off more than what can be seen . its ideas do not completely vanish in flames by the film's end but just smolder , even though the film never veers from being nihilistic . the dutch-born paul verhoeven ( starship troopers/total recall/showgirls/basic instinct ) , a director i never thought much of before as being subtle , thoroughly hating his fascistic parody , starship troopers , and being only mildly accepting of his other sleazy films , directed this thriller with an eye to his staple signature as an auteur -- of misanthropy and lurid erotic behavior combined with mindbending special-effects . the special effects are truly stunning , as we watch the gorilla become invisible , as her body when it changes looks like one of those see-through bodies in an anatomy textbook . i might not have had much use for the creepy sebastian , but i understood his human defects : his selfish motivations and his sexual curiosity , as annoying as those faults may be , at least it is something that was explored by the director in his invisible man theme , something other filmmakers of invisible men films haven't done , giving fire to the role kevin bacon so ably played . i also found elisabeth shue to be alluring , offering beauty and vulnerability , a sense of feminine instinctiveness , intelligence and of endeavor , in a film that caught an hypnotic sense of cynicism and ran with it . the remaining cast members looked as if they would be part of a research team and filled the film with the proper atmosphere needed . this is not a slasher film per se but it could be , it had all the gore required for a movie appealing to teens looking for a film with a quick mindless thrill . i found it to be most like a pop culture treat ala hollywood , adding its own brand of vitriolic delights to the sci-fi/horror genre , which has spawned many films with much the same tendencies , such as "" aliens "" and "" the fly ( 86 ) , "" but none with the same erotic tendencies and magnificent special effects . this one's a visual delight , much more intense and sleazier than the other recent similar films of this type , but one that can only push the pop culture button so far , because what does it all mean seems to be lost in the hollowness of the story itself .",DSc

"bad behaviour could easily be called a few days in the life of gerry and ellie mcallister if that title was commercially viable . reminiscent in tone , if not content , to mike leigh's life is sweet , bad behaviour can ( perhaps unfairly ) be pigeonholed into the "" slice of life "" motion picture category . the film really doesn't go anywhere , but the audience experiences an easygoing , amiable ride along the way . when all is said and done , little happens in this movie except that we've gotten to know a few interesting and witty characters . nevertheless , it's highly unlikely that anyone will feel cheated . at first i thought stephen rea was giving a rather lackluster performance , but continuing exposure to his gerry brought a revelation : rea had immersed himself so completely in the role that what i was reacting to was gerry himself - a stodgy , rather uninspiring sort of individual . likewise , sinead cusack dons her part with considerable flair . most of the humor in bad behaviour is dry , but there are a few instances likely to spark laughter ( most of which involve howard or the nunn brothers ) . as is usually the case in the best examples of these sorts of films , there's an element of poignancy present , but it's neither maudlin enough to sidetrack the production , nor overt enough to lead to straight melodrama . everything is kept in the proper proportion , leading to an energetic , entertaining movie-going experience . perhaps as interesting as the movie itself is the story of how it was brought into being , and how the characters came to be developed . if the writing credit above looks a little odd , it's because director les blair relied as much upon his cast as himself to develop gerry , ellie , and friends . bad behaviour comes close to being an improvisational motion picture . from there , the writer/director developed a 25-page script that described the storyline , but contained no dialogue ( the characters' lines were developed during the rehearsals ) . bad behaviour is an intelligent , insightful film that suffers only from uneven pacing and an occasional tendency to be too "" talky "" . once it gets going , the movie is intensely fascinating , but it takes nearly half the running length before the audience begins to get a real feel for the characters and situations . bad behaviour's strengths are much more apparent than its weaknesses , however , and it's worth a trip to a theater .",JBe

"" in the second act , we have merivel among the quakers trying to be a physician again . this is done a bit too realistically for my taste . for some reason , meg ryan attempts a thick irish accent whereas the other people have little noticeable accents . it is quite distracting . we learn many interesting historical tidbits like when a plague strikes a building everyone in it is quarantined whether sick or not , which usually means they will all die . i have just skimmed the surface of this tale . you can learn almost all of the above facts in the marvelous trailer for the movie . in fact the trailer is much better that the film itself . in the trailer the music ( james newton howard ) is heavy and dramatic , the energy level is high , and the images are so strong they have a spirituality . after seeing the trailer i almost expected to see something on the level of the ten commandments . while watching restoration i realized that i wished they would have just put the trailer on an endless loop and let me watch it for two hours . i liked restoration , but i would have much preferred the trailer . the problem with restoration can be summed up in two words , poor direction . the compelling visuals are populated with a bunch of actors actresses plying their trade not viable characters . i found them all interesting , but never did i find them believable . when tragedy strikes in the show , i didn't care . i thought sam neill's performance to be the best of a mediocre lot . this is a shame since the actors and actresses are some of the best . restoration stops way too fast at 1 : 53 . it is rated r for tame ogres , some sex , brief male and female nudity , and way too realistic medieval medical practices . it would be fine for any teenager . it is such an incredible exercise in style that i am glad i saw it so i give it a thumbs up and award it  , but i felt cheated after seeing the trailers and knowing what could have been .",SRh

"starring : juliette binoche , benoit regent , charlotte very . screenplay : krzysztof kieslowski & krzysztof piesiewicz . i can't claim that my experience with french films has been all that extensive , but the limited experience i have had has lent itself to the following stereotypical image : two characters sitting in a dimly lit cafe , smoking cigarettes and speaking cryptically to one another in extremely muted tones . these films tended to deal with emotionally stunted people in an emotionally stunted manner , potentially intriguing but inert , if not downright soporific . it caused me no end of amusement to find a scene exactly like the one i just described in krzysztof kieslowski's three colors : blue . it caused me more pleasure to discover that scene only one part of a complex and fascinating character study of grief , directed with a mesmerizing grace . so now i wonder . . . is it french cinema that has changed , or is it me ? from a narrative standpoint , blue is not the most easily accessible of films . there is very little dialogure , in fact very little sound of any kind ; even the car crash is notable for its understatement . only the occasional explosions of zbigniew preisner's score tend to break the silence , loading the music with significance . kieslowski chooses to allow us into julie's world almost entirely through images , but how arresting those images are . it's a confident but rarely showy directing job by kieslowski , allowing julie's story to unfold slowly and clearly . the centerpiece of blue is the performance of juliette binoche as julie , and it's a winner . while not the type of performance american film audiences are used to seeing , it is nonetheless extremely effective . at times the role might appear one-note , yet there are deeper shadings . binoche proves herself as deserving as any actor this year of oscar consideration . where blue is likely to irritate many is in the deliberate opaquity of some of its images . blue proves to be very slow going at times , and requires immense patience . however , as details concerning the relationship between julie and patrice unfold , such patience will be proved worthwhile . three colors : blue is an intensely focused examination of one woman's attempt at self-deception for her own perceived good , and will likely stick with me for some time .",SRe
"takeshi "" beat "" kitano is certainly a unique director , whose absurdist style of filmmaking is readily recognizable , achieving auteur status . he has a fascination with gangsters , violence , and in presenting his quirky black humor in a most compelling way . his films are always visually startling , with a bevy of bizarre shots , and , so far , all his films have gotten away with a mindless but intriguing storyline . he is so fascinating to watch , that it is shame we couldn't see more of his lunacy ; instead , the supporting cast , funny as they are with their deadpan humor , nevertheless , they cannot carry the film , and kitano has chosen to center the film around them . fortunately , there are plenty of his usual visual treats in this film , that make the film seem special anyhow . kitano , also , relishes giving women roles that could be considered demeaning . though it is sickeningly amusing to see how rough-shod he treats them in so callous and an ungentlemanly manner , that one might be caught ruefully laughing at them getting dumped on and treated as garbage , and supposedly liking it and coming back for more , it still shows that he doesn't really know how to portray women on screen . maybe he knows something i don't know . but there is never any romance in his films that amount to anything , and this film is no exception . this mindless act escalates on both sides , and , of course , it makes no sense . this is all casually done , as if this kind of mayhem was as natural as eating rice cakes . if there is any point to this story , and i am not sure there is , but the message here might be , that friends are needed to help you out , no one is immune from the insanity that is in the air , because according to kitano , insanity is catching . and , if taking a stand alone against many , you are in deep trouble . somehow this visual feast of a film was strangely appealing and original in all aspects of filmmaking . so let me say bravo to the one time stand-up comedian who doesn't know how to make a safe film , and tip my eagle baseball hat to him , not only for hitting a home run , but showing that one can hit a home run but not score the needed winning run by running past the man who was on base . a cult film delight as a cruel form of entertainment , that is not for all tastes , naturally . incidently , the american title to the film , boiling point , is misleading : in japanese the title refers in slang to a baseball score .",DSc
"monument ave . what makes this over-used type of storyline for many recent films , stand out from the rest , is that there is no mistake , this is the actual mentality of the neighborhood . the film is seen through the eyes of bobby , the film's low-life protagonist . we are stuck with him , perhaps , to a certain extent even commiserating with him , seeing that he can't escape from being born into a life of crime , even if he has a good mum and doesn't appear to be a really bad sort of a person , just a little wild and rough in spots . that is the deep sadness about the film , it traps everyone into its malaise , and we feel that there can be no getting out of the neighborhood or the criminal ways these street people cling to . it all seems so pointless . monument ave . works well as a potently atmospheric film , that captures the mood of a neighborhood but cannot penetrate the souls of the individuals who live there . when they have inane conversations about movie stars' tits and their frivolous neighborhood adventures , while snorting coke and getting boozed up , it all seems to be a tragically wasteful way of life . even with all their bravado , they feel and act like losers . as the message is simply , that nothing changes here .",DSc

"director : david fincher . mpaa rating : r ( violence , gore , profanity , sexual situations , nudity ) running time : 139 minutes . in this year of our lord 1999 , when all things millennial are hotter than the coming apocalyptic purges , i give you david fincher -- official filmmaker of the dark night of our collective 21st century soul . seven was one of the decade's most chilling visions of societal madness made flesh ; the game turned existential crisis into engrossing suspense . no one in popular culture seems to understand our demons better . no one more effectively shows the deceptive ease with which our stable world can be yanked out from under us . in his adaptation of chuck palahniuk's savagely brilliant novel fight club , fincher delves once again into the bowels of our uber-psyche -- quite literally in the propulsive , dust brothers-scored opening credits sequence -- and announces that a lot of us are walking very close to the edge . it might surprise a lot of people to discover that fight club is actually a comedy . certainly it's not a comedy in the big daddy or mickey blue eyes sense , and not just because this one is actually funny . it's a comedy like a clockwork orange was a comedy , a social satire so caustic you laugh with a sharp intake of breath . norton's wonderfully dry narration includes dozens of scathing punch lines , many of them drawn directly from palahniuk's text . and it had to be ; there's no other way to tell a story like fight club without wallowing in didacticism . many critics and social conservatives have already offered up kill-the-messenger diatribes against the film's brutality and anarchist sub-plots , yet another depressing reminder that some people need their messages delivered to them in solemn "" isn't this a very , very bad thing "" tones . at its heart , fight club is a warning about the percolating discontent that has exploded into well-publicized acts of violence in this country . it also peeks into the capacity for violent action we may not even realize we possess , the testosterone id bubbling beneath the veneer of civilization . if the approach to those subjects had ever become overtly preachy , fight club would have become a glossy social science dissertation -- a big screen version of susan faludi's emasculated-american-male study "" stiffed . "" instead , fight club taps into something primal , then takes it into the realm of the absurd -- subliminal penises , liposuction soap and all . weaving it all together is fincher , as distinctive and unconventional a filmmaker as any working in mainstream theatrical films . fight club is a kinetic work with plenty of visual flourishes and jolting sound design , yet it never feels like an all-out sensory pummeling -- it's the film oliver stone probably wanted natural born killers to be , but lacked the subtlety to pull of . the film only sags during a late surge of exposition , a necessary evil that still feels awkward . when fincher is allowed to plunge into fight club's dizzying array of themes and subtexts , the result is as provocatively entertaining a film as you could hope for . if the violence unnerves -- or becomes even more unnerving when accompanied by vicious wit -- that's only because it should . fight club keeps you off balance , its incendiary vision leavened by the unexpected humor . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .",SRe

"although several years in the past , his disastrous version of the bonfire of the vanities is still fresh in the minds of everyone unfortunate enough to have endured it , and his "" return "" to the thriller genre with raising cain wasn't a whole lot more promising . carlito's way is a step up , but this is not the same depalma who got the adrenaline moving with the untouchables . carlito's way has a number of superbly-directed action sequences , and there are moments of absolute brilliance , but these are connected by a plodding narrative that sputters to find an appropriate pace . two hours and twenty minutes is too long for this motion picture ; there are numerous scenes that could have found their way to the cutting room floor without sacrificing much of the story . the last half-hour has the electricity of any good thriller , except for one little problem : we already know the ending . carlito's way is not one of these . by knowing that carlito is going to be shot ( not to mention how it's going to happen ) , it drains away suspense from the big chase through grand central station . in fact , it's amazing that depalma manages to raise the finale to the level of excitement he achieves . presenting carlito's way in this curious fashion is apparently motivated by a desire to have al pacino narrate the story . this is a bad decision in more than one way , since the voice-overs are largely redundant , consisting of observations like "" i had a bad feeling about this "" or "" bad move , "" most of which the viewer can figure out on his or her own . coming off of his virtuoso performance in scent of a woman , one expects a lot from pacino , and he really doesn't deliver . his portrayal of carlito is competent , but not masterful . while it's helpful to remember that a below-par offering from pacino is often better than an outstanding job by many other actors , that doesn't prevent the viewer from comparing this to scarface , serpico , scent , and justice for all , and the godfathers . pacino fails to invest carlito with much energy , and there are times when the performance is flat . also , it becomes something of a challenge to identify pacino's constantly-shifting accent . sometimes it sounds puerto rican ( which it's supposed to be ) , but there are moments when it strays towards italian or is marked by a leftover southern strain from scent of a woman . perhaps the biggest surprise with respect to the cast is that pacino gets out-acted by sean penn , who hardly looks like himself with frizzy hair and nerdy glasses . penn plays an exceptionally annoying lawyer who spends most of his time snorting cocaine , and he does an excellent job in this low-key , but critical , role . for the most part , penelope ann miller is "" just there . "" her gail is perhaps too sweet to work in a strip joint and be the boyfriend of a gangster ; it isn't until one of her last scenes when we see a harder edge , and even then her performance verges on histrionics . gail's love is supposed to represent carlito's redemption , and the reason he thinks dreams are worth having , but i'm not sure the connection between them is strong enough for this to come across . david koepp's screenplay has some winning lines ( such as "" favor gonna kill you faster than a bullet "" ) , which isn't surprising considering the source material . technically , carlito's way is a combination of the innovative and the banal . the camerawork is invigorating , if sometimes a bit too exotic . depalma makes good use of the steadicam during the chase sequences , and this heightens whatever tension is present . the composer may do exceptional work for kenneth branagh , but his other movie music isn't particularly noteworthy . carlito's way probably should have been a taut thriller , but choices by depalma in both presentation and editing have hamstrung it . with the expectations for this film as high as they were , the impact should have been more forceful , and the focus better tuned .",JBe

"all right , i'll admit it : i'm guilty of a bias towards writers . perhaps it's the part of me that identifies with them , or the romantic image of a guy alone in a room staring down a blank sheet of paper in a battered manual smith-corona until the paper blinks first . the fact is that when i feel a project has gone sour , the writer is frequently the last target of my wrath , and the first one to get the benefit of the doubt . not this time . i can't think of a director alive who could have done anything with cops & robbersons , or an actor who could have made it watchabel . to call this script inept would be to give it more credit than it deserves . it is exceedingly difficult to imagine what bernie somers was thinking when he started putting this mess together . there isn't a single original situation or character to be found , but that can be said of eight scripts out of ten that come out of hollywood . the more telling point is that somers didn't seem to have a clue where to go with this story . the predictable resolution would have been for milquetoast norman to discover an inner reserve of strength and end up saving the day . but even that simplistic an answer seems to be beyond his grasp . norman begins and ends the film exactly the same , and there isn't even a pat answer provided for why there is anything different in the way his family would treat him . please , my heart can't take any more surprises . the biggest losers , however , are probably the two names above the title . still , it would have been nice if he hadn't walked through the film as though he were still stunned by the cancellation of his talk show . he's not even as endearingly incompetent as the vacation series' clark griswold , just deathly boring . jack palance doesn't fare much better , but he does have an innate gruff charm that transcends the role as written ; however , that still doesn't explain why the robbersons seem so instantly drawn to jake despite his abusiveness , nor why jake eventually reciprocates . even at bargain prices , that's two bucks a laugh . * that's * a crime .",SRe

"somehow this quirky , egocentric , fantasy black-and-white film about a british filmmaker learning to dance the tango from a master , works in an obscure way by getting us hooked on what's going on . it works so well because the dancing was so natural and magnificently performed , even if the wistful romantic story never caught my imagination and the philosophizing about her being a jew seemed more diverting than engrossing ( in real-life she's not jewish but an avowed atheist who was only influenced by her jewish neighbors and their culture ) . the 48-year-old sally potter ( she plays herself ) , while filming in paris a technicolor thriller ( it seemed like dreck and is probably some kind of personal statement potter is making about hollywood films ) about a legless fashion designer in a wheelchair murdering models dressed in brightly colored costumes . "" i've always wanted to be in films , "" says the thirtysomething pablo . it sounds like a trade-off in self-indulgences , and all i can say , is why not ! when sally dances the tango in the film , that's really her and not a double . and if she can dance the part , why not play the part ! for whatever arcane reason ( or most likely no reason at all ) , the story has twelve dance lessons which come to divide the film into chapters . she returns to paris after being disappointed that her hollywood backers complained that it would be better for the box office if the film was to be in english instead of french and that she should cast a different villain because it would be difficult to cast a legless person . she shoots back , "" you danced as a soloist -- like a stranger -- and i lost you .

"" it also seems strangely appropriate that bugs bunny is voiced by billy west ; with its bodily functions humor , space jam seems less like a vehicle for bugs than one for west's other cartoon voice roles , ren and stimpy . murray's comic persona is the human descendent of bugs bunny , a wiseacre rebel unfairly smarter than his adversaries , and he is a riot in his scant minutes . space jam is a commercial construct , and it feels like it . how sad that a brilliant comic creation like bugs bunny has to ride shotgun with a wooden basketball star , all to provide a set of collector's cups .",SRe

"if it does nothing else , the ghost and the darkness will make you realize just how brilliant steven spielberg's execution of jaws is . using a similar ( albeit land-bound ) premise -- hunting down bloodthirsty predators -- this movie devolves into a silly series of animal attacks and chases . the camerawork is frenetic and confusing , and the big confrontations are as likely to provoke unintentional laughter as edge- of-the-seat excitement . in his 1975 thriller , spielberg proved that the man-against- beast struggle , if done properly , can make for a compelling motion picture . with the ghost and the darkness , director stephen hopkins tries unsuccessfully to generate the same level of tension . while hopkins' film making skills aren't of the same caliber as spielberg's ( one man made a nightmare on elm street 5 ; the other , schindler's list ) , the lion's share of the blame for this movie's failure can be laid squarely on the shoulders of veteran screenwriter william goldman , whose script is contrived and inadequate . in jaws , it was thrilling to watch the failed attempts to kill the enemy ; here , it's just frustrating . actually , taken as high camp , it's possible to enjoy the ghost and the darkness on a reasonably consistent basis . in addition to giving kilmer and douglas some wonderfully loony lines of dialogue , the script spends a lot of time on unnecessarily convoluted schemes to kill the beasts . somehow , i don't think hopkins intended this scene to be as funny as it is . there is a promising , although largely unexplored , story buried within the ghost and the darkness . building a railroad bridge across the tsavo river has the potential to generate some potent drama . of course , the ghost and the darkness is only interested in this material as background , so no attempt is made to examine the pressures and difficulties of railroad construction . and , man-eating animals aside , what about the inherent difficulties of raising such an imposing structure under stringent time and environmental constraints ? at first , i thought the film makers' reluctance to give us a good , clear view of them was to build suspense . unfortunately , it becomes clear that the real reason has more to do with poor special effects than a desire to tease the audience . the animatronic lions look terrible . one wonders why , with all the impressive twisters and spaceships that were zipping around on screens this summer , the ghost and the darkness can't come up with a pair of credible lions . val kilmer is either badly miscast , bored , or a combination of the two . his patterson is dull and largely unsympathetic . as a hero , he leaves a lot to be desired . unfortunately , douglas doesn't show up until the film is half over , so it's necessary to struggle through the first forty-five minutes without his energetic boost . for those who are interested in observing the habits of real lions and viewing genuine life-and-death struggles in africa , i direct your attention to the leopard son , which is still in theatrical release . that well-constructed documentary has stronger drama , tension , and cinematography than the supposedly-real story told in the ghost and the darkness . true , it's missing tom wilkinson sneering , michael douglas smirking , and val kilmer looking bored , but no movie can boast everything . -- ingmar bergman",JBe

"mulan , which we saw being developed in disney's florida studios , is the first disney animated movie produced on the east coast . the impressive result , although not as spectacular as some of disney's recent offerings , bodes well for this isolated , creative team . filmed in medium blues with warm rose accents , the animation is handsome albeit not up to standards of the lion king . best in the crowd sequences , the movie has a most awe-inspiring visual of an attacking horde of huns , with hundreds of bluish-gray men charging over a snow-covered landscape . although the film's images are sumptuous , its songs are all eminently forgettable . mulan fails miserably even with a cheat sheet of the right answers written on her arm . eddie murphy , who mumbles too many of his lines , plays the dragon , mushu . the energetic murphy tries to be robin williams , but murphy's lines aren't anywhere near aladdin quality . the recruits try to out macho each other with lines like , "" i'm going to hit you so hard it will make your ancestors dizzy .

"it strikes me that there are certain similarities between jack and phenomenon . both use relative innocents as their central characters . both attempt to attract a mature audience . and , most importantly , both offer drama-based alternatives to the relentless action films that have come to characterize the summer of 1996 . if there's going to be a sleeper hit this summer , jack is a reasonable candidate . this feel-good motion picture is intelligently written and expertly directed -- qualities which many similar movies cannot boast . cross big with forrest gump , and you get an idea of where jack's appeal lies . the premise for jack , although seemingly simple , is riddled with potential problems -- nearly all of which the script not only addresses , but answers without a whiff of condescension . the child has an internal clock that's ticking four times faster than usual . the script for jack , credited to james demonaco and gary nadeau , is a well-balanced mix of drama and comedy . it's rarely maudlin , and manages to be affecting without heavy-handed manipulation . the film has an excellent grasp of what it's like to be in fifth grade . it's perhaps an idealized vision of elementary school , but there are enough aspects of reality not to jolt our suspension of disbelief . one of the most difficult issues jack has to deal with is the title character's rapid aging . a shooting star passes quickly , but , while it's here , it's the most beautiful thing you'll ever want to see . "" the movie never shies away from confronting jack's mortality . robin williams is entirely believable as a ten-year old . he has all the mannerisms and vocal inflections perfected -- whining when he doesn't get his way , pulling at his shirts , adjusting his pants , and so forth . the only recent movie where an adult so perfectly emulated a child was big , and , indeed , jack has much in common with the tom hanks feature , both in terms of subject matter and broad audience appeal . williams brings a lot of humor to his portrayal , but , with francis ford coppola in control , the comic's eccentricities are kept carefully under reign , and this results in a near-perfect performance . the supporting cast is surprisingly solid . it's good- natured , funny , heartwarming , and capable of being viewed on more than one level . children will relate to jack differently than their parents , although , with its "" soft "" pg-13 , the film isn't for the very young . jack deserves that sort of recognition .",JBe

"" it's all spectacularly sloppy , but it's hard to know whom to blame . stanley might have wanted to do a cerebral observation on violence and/or religion , but frankenheimer seems to want a good old thriller , and the two angles are not at all complementary . somebody cut this film to ribbons trying to find a point to it all , resulting in a giddy incomprehensibility . exactly what was douglas' role in moreau's experiments supposed to be , anyway ? moreau just keeps staggering forward and swinging wildly , like an overweight boxer without the faintest glimmer of strategy . speaking of overweight . . . oh , but that's far too easy . it would be too simple to observe that when brando makes his first appearance , covered in heavy white makeup and a white muu-muu the size of a circus tent , he looks like nothing so much as the michelin man on safari . it's too simple and somewhat unfair , because even under the burden of all that weight and a ridiculous accent , there is still something compelling about brando on screen . his moreau is what richard attenborough should have been trying to go for as hammond in jurassic park , a pleasant enough chap with a monstrous god complex . val kilmer , who is said to have quite a god complex in real life , seems to have decided to act in a completely different film , one which is much more fun . his montgomery is a casually nasty pot-head , but at least he is entertaining to watch , particularly when he does his dead-on brando impression . and poor david thewlis , whose character has no common sense and no particular reason for being a u . n . peace negotiator ( you'd think that might have been a useful subtext to the war which breaks out on the island ) , tries to look frightened by more than the lack of direction in the film , with little success . but this is a badly fragmented piece of work which manages to achieve tedium in only 96 minutes . perhaps some day they will make a documentary about the making of the film , like they did with apocalypse now in hearts of darkness . then maybe it won't have been a total loss .",SRe
"as the old adage goes , be careful what you wish for lest you get it and , by implication , loathe it . starring macaulay culkin in his first big role , the movie was a hit for its slapstick humor as well as the age-old theme of a kid who bests the grown-ups .

"billy bob thornton has presented me with a wonderful dilemma in sling blade : i don't know where to begin praising him . there are writers who get a shot at directing films , and actors who do some writing , and film-makers who take the occasional turn in front of a camera , but in most cases you can tell you are watching a writer direct , or an actor write , or a director act . in sling blade , you never feel as though you are watching a writer try to act , or an actor try to direct . you realize you are watching a natural born story-teller who understands that the words , the performers and the images are not discrete elements , but indivisible parts of a cohesive story . his setting , an insular southern town , is rendered with a vivid combination of characters and locations ; his characters , down to the last minor player , are given personalities uniquely their own . but it is the remarkable dexterity with which thornton weaves the threads of his story that makes sling blade so powerful . karl's story is heart-breaking because he always is striving to do the right thing , but it is terribly hard for him to get his mind around what that right thing is supposed to be . playing someone with a mental or emotional handicap is one of the most treacherous assignments in acting ( right up there with playing an alcoholic ) , because it is so easy to nail the character's twitches without nailing his soul . the former can be achieved through technical proficiency and a gift for mimicry , with dustin hoffman in rain man and geoffrey rush in shine as a couple of showy recent examples . neither of those roles , however , showed us a character trying to grow as a person , and that is what thornton accomplishes in sling blade . while thornton does turn in an exceptional physical performance , which his polite demeanor and quirky speech patterns , he does not allow karl to be defined by the way he talks . this isn't a character you feel sorry for , like a pet ; this is a man you feel for as a fellow human being . thornton the director draws similar superb performances from his entire cast , particularly dwight yoakam ( yes , _that_ dwight yoakam ) as the cruel doyle . he is casually chilling as he mixes insults and threats with chuckles and expressions of endearment as though incapable of telling the difference , and we can see the pathetic man behind the monster . complexities spill over from sling blade , a film so perfectly crafted and acted from the moment karl leaves the hospital that i wish thornton had reconsidered the first fifteen minutes . it is an awkward conceit which gets sling blade off to an uneven start , but it is just as well thornton demonstrated imperfection as a director . with the kind of flawless work he does as writer and star of sling blade , he might have become positively insufferable if he had directed a perfect film as well .",SRe
"do you like reading short stories ? are you willing to stay with a picture where not much happens but where you get to eavesdrop on a host of endearing characters ? well , if you do , i have just the film for you , rendezvous in paris ( les rendez-vous de paris ) . films today either sex or don't . there is little time for romance . actually , that is over with quickly too so they can cut to the action scenes and the violence which is understood to be what it takes to sell tickets these days . remember nothing sells popcorn like a film full of fistfights and car chases . there is a subtler form of romance known as flirting and few films waste time with that . rendezvous in paris has such non-stop flirting that it could have been called flirting except that title was taken . when you leave you may yourself winking at the person at the snack bar unless you are careful . this film puts you in love with love . the format for the film is that there are three short stories . introducing each are some hokey street singers and images that look like they are lifted straight out of a 50s film . the picture itself was consciously filmed with a hazy look by cinematographer diane baratier . the director wanted this nostalgic look , but it may send you to the concession stand to complain until you know it is on purpose . this story ends in the biggest twist , but all three stories have somewhat of a surprising ending . we were in paris this summer , and i found the second story reminded me of our trip . we saw more intense necking on the streets in a week than i've seen in several years in cities in america . rendezvous in paris is a wonderful talkfest of a film . if there is any recent movie that even remotely resembles it , it would probably be that wonderful film before sunrise from last year . some may criticize rendezvous in paris as being inconsequential , but for me it is a real treat that grows on you as you see it and is one of those few films whose images are indelibly marked in your memory . finally , the actors are mainly a bunch of unknowns , but all deliver strong performances . their screen presence is incredible , and the camera is love with them . it is in french ( appropriately called the language of love ) , but with sharp and easy to read english subtitles . it is rated pg , and there is nothing to offend anyone of any age . there is no sex , nudity , violence , or bad language . except that three year olds will have little interest in romance , the film could easily have been rated g . i recommend the show to anyone of any age interested in love and flirting , and i award it  . now , don't forget to be careful when you pass the person at the snack bar if your spouse is with you . in the real world , flirting can get you in a lot of trouble .",SRh

"" although the major characters in safe are heterosexual , haynes , an openly homosexual film maker , states that he believes this to be a "" gay film .

"at some time or another , every generation has a movie made about it . just about every type is represented : the timid nerd looking for a way to break out of his shell , the mindless jock , the overaged twentysomething guy who likes hanging out with teenagers , the blond bombshell , the stoned-out-of-his mind pot addict , and the timid newcomer . most of what works with the youthful population of dazed and confused is due more to the performances of a fine cast than the writing . there isn't much to this picture . the storyline is minimal and the characters' personalities are as hazy as the marijuana-drenched atmosphere . you'd have to climb into a time machine to get a better view . both have similar aims , but while graffiti's plot may have been no less insignificant than that of dazed and confused , its characters are better defined . at times , linklater seems too wrapped up in getting everything about the time period right . while the directors of both films care about their characters , george lucas does a better job of transferring that feeling to the audience . the two characters that we get the most of - randy and mitch - manage to capture our sympathies - at least most of the time . my complaint has nothing to do with them , but with everyone else . except during an occasional scene or two , i had no feeling one way or another about anybody except those two . had virtually the entire senior class died in a car wreck , i wouldn't have batted an eyelash . none of the principals can have a clear memory of 1976 ( unless they're a lot older than they look ) , yet they play their roles like they lived through it . ensemble movies are something of a rarity these days , so it's a bit odd that this is the third one i've seen in a week ( the other two being twenty bucks and short cuts ) . if done right , these types of films can be riveting . my impression of dazed and confused is that it's light entertainment suitable for a night out , but nothing more . the comedy isn't as sharply- honed as it might be , but it's effective in this context . this film was made to celebrate a dead culture , and those who were part of , or are merely curious about , will find a path into the past through this motion picture . dazed and confused is irresponsible and politically incorrect - and almost worth applauding on those grounds alone . had it possessed a little more substance , i would have heartily championed the film , but as it is , i can give it little more than a lukewarm recommendation . if nothing else , it surely defines the era , and reminds me more of the things i hated than loved about 1976 .",JBe
"the previews for muriel's wedding liken this latest australian import to two of its predecessors , strictly ballroom and the adventures of priscilla , queen of the desert . these are inaccurate , not to mention misleading , comparisons . those expecting something light and airy from this tragic-comedy are in for an unpleasant surprise , for , while muriel's wedding has its moments of exhilarating humor , it is , as often as not , downbeat and even mean-spirited . perhaps the best recent antecedent to muriel's wedding is proof . both films are from house/moorhouse productions ( writer/director p . j . hogan is married to co-producer jocelyn moorhouse ) , and , while this film lacks proof's seamless marriage of comedy and drama , there are distinct similarities in tone and pacing . muriel's wedding could easily be viewed as a social commentary thinly disguised as something a little less pretentious . certainly , one is more likely to emerge from this motion picture with a less upbeat attitude than the one resulting from ballroom or priscilla . one of the most pleasant aspects of muriel's wedding is the distinctly unconventional third act . no one seeing this movie will confuse it with a hollywood picture , as it continually flouts the "" feel good "" formulas that typically characterize this sort of romantic comedy . the ending is far-from-perfect , but it's a great deal better than several obvious alternatives . nevertheless , parts of muriel's wedding are heavy-handed and , as a result , needlessly uncomfortable to view . there are times when hogan almost seems to enjoy belittling and degrading muriel . while it's necessary to understand her low self-image , the director goes to excessive , almost-sadistic , lengths to get his point across . on these occasions , the film becomes a little difficult to endure . balancing these moments are some high-energy scenes , including a wonderful lip-synch of abba's "" waterloo "" by muriel and rachel , muriel trying on wedding dresses to the tune of "" dancing queen "" , and an almost- sex scene featuring sofa cushions being unzipped instead of skirts . the soundtrack , featuring at least five abba songs , is effectively energetic , and includes a peter best-arranged instrumental version of "" dancing queen "" performed by a full orchestra . those who rely on miramax's ads to prepare them for muriel's wedding may be disappointed , but that's not the film's fault . muriel's wedding isn't a perfect comedy , tragedy , or drama , but it contains enough original elements of each to make it worth a look . ultimately , however , individual enjoyment of this picture may be in direct proportion to a viewer's ability to tolerate abba's omnipresent music .",JBe
"dennis schwartz "" movie reviews and poetry "" whether the story is entirely true or in some parts made up , as the director stated it is , is unimportant ; the film covers the intriguing subject matter of how four single new yorkers exist for a period of nine months , featuring the real lives of two female and two male actors who play themselves , concerned with getting older and still being single . their single scene is provocatively portrayed as being sad and luridly comical . that these four are not particularly people that i can readily sympathize with , does not alter the fact that this is a very human story being told , one that has many implications on our culture , relating how alienated a people so many of us have become in this modern world . the result is an interesting and stylized docudrama , a "" rear window "" for singles . this time it is not a crime that we see , but is a voyeurist's delight , and there is something that seems to excite us when we sneak a look at what someone does in the privacy of their own home , as if we are seeing something about them that we shouldn't see . but it is the four singles who remain the focus of the film , which is really not a documentary , except in its style . this could be a personal ad about her , if it also included that she wants a guy not for sex or love ( she can have sex whenever she wants to ) , but for monetary reasons . michael de stephano is the nicest one of the four , except this little negative fixation he has about homosexuals . he is serious , stable , and straightforward , and sounds a lot like what women want in guy , but he says that is what they say they want , but in reality they are really attracted to the jerks who lie to them and treat them badly , going after them just for the sex . he is obnoxious but not as obnoxious as he makes himself out to be . though it is very hard to feel sympathy for him , especially after he shows us how he will get out of a date with a mutt , which in his lingo , is an ugly dog , by having someone at work beep him so he can make an excuse to leave . this film might be upsetting to some , but it is a fresh look at an old problem , and its aim is readily accomplished , as it offers us an unorthodox study in human behavior under the guise of being a documentary .",DSc

"every time audiences are presented with a reasonably well-made serial killer movie , they line up for it . why ? human beings are irresistibly fascinated by the lurid , the horrifying , and the depraved , and what could be more attention-grabbing than an individual who murders repeatedly in sick and twisted ways ? of course , serial killers ( both real and fictional ) have provided material for countless movies , but most of those are artless hack jobs , replacing tension and intelligence with gore and cliches . so , when a movie comes along that's a cut above the usual , it's worth making note of . kiss the girls is such a film . i'm not saying that kiss the girls is a great motion picture , nor am i arguing that it's the best of its kind to come out in recent years . but it features a pair of well-developed characters , the plot contains some clever twists and turns , the dialogue is reasonable , and director gary fleder ( things to do in denver when you're dead ) keeps the level of tension and intrigue high . put together , all of that adds up to a worthwhile motion picture . fans of seven , copycat , and silence of the lambs will likely agree that their $8 admission for kiss the girls is well spent . kiss the girls wouldn't be nearly as involving without the two strong performances of the leads . freeman plays alex as an insightful , confident investigator with powerful emotions bubbling just beneath his calm , carefully-controlled exterior . as kate , judd adds another impressive performance to a growing resume . the actress plays her character as outwardly-tough and self-sufficient with an inner core of vulnerability . nevertheless , vulnerability , whether emotional or physical , is something she has a hard time coping with . one thing i appreciate about kiss the girls is its willingness to spend time developing the characters before jumping into the main story . there are times when it manifests itself almost as a father/daughter bond , but , on other occasions , there's a sense of latent romance . however , the film underplays this dynamic to avoid wandering off on a tangent . despite being consistently involving , kiss the girls , based on the best-selling novel by james patterson , has its share of flaws . on several occasions , the film's blatant ignorance of real-world police procedures strains the viewer's credibility . i also have a gripe about the end scenes , which are overly familiar . with one exception , the acting is solid . although elwes only portrays a small-town cop , and doesn't steal any scenes , he's never particularly believable , and every time he's on screen , he sticks out like a sore thumb . the film makers , with a nod to the success of seven , have apparently decided to mimic the grim atmosphere and in-your-face cinematography of that movie ( light , darkness , and shadow are used to great effect here ) . stylistically , kiss the girls is very similar , and the presence of morgan freeman only heightens the connection . even though there are vast plot differences between the two , both are well- made and are likely to appeal to the same kind of audience . so , much like seven , kiss the girls makes for a suspenseful , if somewhat bleak , two hours .

"hollywood loves to remake popular shows . when it is too soon to do a remake , it likes to take a recent movie and reconstitute it with slightly different ingredients . in director james foley's fear , not to be confused with gregory hoblit's excellent primal fear , writers christopher crowe and james foley take fatal attraction and repackage it with teenager lovers rather than adults and hope for an instant hit . the romantic obsession part works marginally well , but the film's commentary on teenagers and their relationships with their parents is insightful and worth hearing . the huge downfall in the picture , is that the writers run out of ideas , so they transform the last thirty minutes of the film into a bad , tasteless , and frightening horror flick . most horror pictures you can ignore because they are so hokey and unbelievable , but the tolerably good first part of the film sets you up to care about the people in fear so the ending is much more disturbing that any unrealistic blood and gore film would be . it gives you premature wrinkles .

"( to describe the exact nature of the event would diminish your enjoyment of the picture , so i will not elaborate further on it . but be careful because i suspect many other reviewers will feel it necessary to tell you more than you strictly need to know and will spoil the movie for you . ) the film is a drama that only begins to introduce substantial comedic elements once it has set a reverential tone . my audience was full of uneasy laughter as it seemed that many viewers didn't quite know what behavior was expected of them -- rather like not being sure when it is acceptable to laugh in church . guilfoyle and a host of other known supporting actors worked for scale on the production according to the director , who was at our screening . the problem with the movie is that , although it isn't a one-joke movie , it is essentially a one-idea one . as a short film , it would have made an intriguing half-hour story . i wished the film had been able to make me care more about the conflict , but it left me finding it all to be little more than a cute stunt . i will give them this . within the confines of the thin storyline , the actors did their best . but sometimes even your best isn't quite enough to save the day . it is not yet rated but would probably be pg-13 for brief nudity . the film would probably not interest those under 13 .",SRh
"i have this sneaking suspicion that the extent to which viewers can appreciate dazed and confused may be limited by how readily they recognize it as a perfect capsule of mid-70s youth culture . it's a clever and completely un-self-conscious portrait of pot-smoking , beer-drinking teenagers revelling in the awareness that right now , nothing else really matters . as frequently as people tend to toss out comparisons between films , i think i can safely say that what american graffiti was to 1962 , dazed and confused is to 1976 . writer/director richard linklater's first feature was slacker , a quirky but gimmicky look at apathetic twenty-somethings that established his talent for creating unique and amusing characters . while many of the characters are recognizable high school types , what i found original was that these were types i actually recognized from high school , not from * movies * about high school . cool but basically decent randy interacts convincingly with both his jock buddies and the inexperienced mitch . linklater gives them sparkling dialogue , daring to let his characters talk like teenagers actually talk . the one major character failing in dazed is the absence of any equally interesting female characters ; many could be interchangeable . this is a male coming-of-age film first and foremost , but it could have been more inclusive . as a film without a real plot , dazed depends on set pieces and atmosphere . the hazing of the junior high girls is lively , as is a wacky monologue by the stoned slater about george and martha washington's fondness for marijuana . however , there's a fair amount of dead space , and it's left to the cast of unknowns to fill it . they are generally personable enough to do so , particularly wiggins and cochrane , but not always . as for atmosphere , it's dead on . dazed captures 1976 brilliantly , from the bell bottoms and feathered hair to the soundtrack of early hard rock classics to a pair of statues painted to look like members of kiss . the production design had to be perfect , and it is . anyone who can't quite recall a time when sex was safe and far fewer kids "" just said no "" should take a look just for the sake of historical accuracy . it's impossible for me to determine whether those not in my age bracket will be as enamored of dazed and confused as i was . it's a slight , loopy little film with no pretensions , and it was a page right out of my own youth . i don't know . . . maybe you had to be there . of course , * i * didn't inhale .",SRe
"pollock , about the renowned and controversial modern artist jackson pollock , is at once intriguing and insightful as well as boring and baffling . ed harris , who stars as pollock , makes his directorial debut with the film . although clearly a labor of love on harris's part , the film amply demonstrates why most actors need someone other than themselves giving them guidance . harris delivers one of his best performances , indeed , another oscar worthy one , but his director spoils what could have been a masterpiece by letting scenes drag on and on . still , for anyone interested in the creative process , the movie can be quite rewarding . it is difficult to show exactly how an artist goes from a blank canvas to a fully realized vision . pollock tries by simply letting us observe pollock at work . with the intense performance by harris as a troubled artist , the creative tension is almost palpable . acting like a manic-depressive , harris portrays pollock as a troubled soul . that he was able to create anything memorable through that alcoholic haze is quite surprising . one well-staged drinking-and-driving episode best illustrates the depth of pollock's troubles . although his work was frequently criticized as consisting of little more than random splashes , pollock defends his technique . basically a one-man show , it does have many other characters in complementary roles . towards the end of the picture , jennifer connelly , who was so spectacular recently in requiem for a dream , plays another of her more typical throwaway roles as the beautiful but vapid ruth klingman , the last of pollock's mistresses . is pollock a beautiful failure or a flawed success ? like his paintings , it is in the eye of the beholder . for me , it was better than a documentary on the history channel and well worth seeing . in an unsympathetic and enigmatic performance , harris creates a fascinating , flawed man of flesh and blood , who throws temper tantrums like a toddler one minute and acts like a recluse the next . if you can stay awake through the long dull periods , you will learn a lot and get to witness one of the best performances of the year in the process . it is rated r for language and brief sexuality and would be acceptable for teenagers .",SRh

"for someone who is a strict traditionalist when it comes to shakespeare , and to opera too for that matter , i was amazed at how much i was enthralled by ian mckellen's vision of richard iii as a world war ii british fascist . this is a well acted production where the images are even more impressive than the acting . usually when critics say the images are the best part of a movie , they are reviewing a mediocre show where the visuals are its redeeming feature . here they enhance an already outstanding production . as an aside , the theater where i saw the film had an overscan problem and the opening title clearly proclaimed the movie to be richard ii so i thought for a second i was going to see a prequel . after hating director oliver parker's recent and dreary rendition of othello , it was refreshing to see director richard loncraine breath such tremendous life-force into richard iii . no since the even better kenneth branagh's henry v and franco zeffirelli's romeo and juliet , have i enjoyed shakespeare so much . the film is based on shakespeare's play , but i believe many of the lines were either rearranged or abbreviated . i read that ian mckellen spent several years trying to sell various hollywood studios on the making of this film , but when the studios read the script , they kept saying that they hoped he made it , but they were not going to be the ones to fiance anything that bizarre . whether there is a big enough audience for a film like this to turn a profit is another question of course . in this speech and most others in the movie , it is pronounced and given nuances fresh and not found in most actors' shakespearean repertoire . the speech actually continues as nature calls , and richard leaves to use the urinal . in most movies i find contrivances like soliloquies in the bathroom to be silly at best , but mckellen's strength of acting manages to pull it off effectively . this is a fascinating and true story that averages a murder every five minutes , and thanks to great editing by paul green , the movie flies along . as richard says , "" plots have i laid . "" as the words moved fast and furiously , i realized why shakespeare is so unapproachable to a mass audience , it requires attention . unlike the sound bites of political campaigns or mtv , all thoughts are not delivered in short sentences full of monosyllabic words designed to let the brain stay on autopilot . i will not insult your intelligence by attempting a condensed version of the story here . instead i will concentrate on reviewing the film itself . the cast is full of good actors and actresses who are coached by the director to give some of their very best performances even though their roles may be quite minor . robert downey jr . , for example , plays rivers and has less than a dozen lines , but delivers them to great effect . adrian dunbar plays tyrell as a chilling man who has almost as few scruples as richard . jim broadbent has a larger ( pun intended ) role as buckingham , playing him as the herman goering of the picture . richard smiles deviously and replies with a sweet voice , "" you have a daughter .

"some critics , including siskel & ebert , are on the record stating that martin scorsese's raging bull , the story of boxer jake la motta , is the best film of the '80s . since there are still a number of '80s films that i haven't seen , i don't feel qualified to make such a judgment , but i'll say this without hesitation : raging bull is a great motion picture , and i would be surprised if more than a handful of films released between january 1 , 1980 and december 31 , 1989 come close to its level . bio-pics often fall into one of two categories : overblown hero- worship or a dry , dull textbook account . it's rare that a movie with the moniker "" based on the life of ? "" comes across as anything more than sporadically energetic and marginally entertaining . raging bull is the perfect counterexample , and a brilliant argument for film makers to continue to work in this genre . the picture takes the life of boxer jake la motta , a middleweight icon from the '40s and '50s , and develops one of the most compelling character studies ever to reach the big screen . for all 129 minutes , director martin scorsese and actor robert de niro ( in the title role ) have us mesmerized by this individual who is by turns sympathetic , sad , and horrifying . sex and violence are inextricably linked . the title is apt ? la motta is a raging bull . outside of it , he is no less vicious or more easily controlled . he does it so badly that an investigation is launched and he is almost thrown out of boxing . raging bull is the other side of rocky . sylvester stallone's tale of boxing triumph was released to great critical acclaim in 1976 . it won the 1977 best picture oscar , and a sequel arrived in theaters before raging bull went into production . but , where rocky romanticizes boxing , raging bull takes a cold , unflinching look at the violence both inside and outside of the ring . rocky shows boxing at its noblest ; raging bull shows it at its most diseased . there's little i can say here that hasn't already said about de niro's performance . in a career that has included many fine roles , this is his most outstanding . the level of intensity de niro brings to la motta is unwavering . and , although there's a lot of travis bickle ( de niro's character in taxi driver ) in la motta , scorsese and de niro go to great lengths to make sure that , if we never fully sympathize with him , at least we understand the forces that drive him . this is a complete characterization and a perfect example of acting . as the fat , older man , de niro gained 50 pounds and turned his body into a grotesque parody of its normal form . how many actors would go that far ? the best oscar statue is only one testimony to the lasting power of the performance . their portrayals have the same raw energy that infuses de niro's . pesci , who has basically re-created the same personality in two other scorsese films ( goodfellas and casino ) , presents joey as a slightly more intelligent version of his brother . the misogyny and violence are still there , only better concealed . scorsese and cinematographer michael chapman elected to shoot the bulk of raging bull in black-and-white ( a few "" home movie "" segments are in color ) . the choice is perfect for the movie , giving raging bull a unique look in an era when a black-and-white approach is almost unheard of . ( one important recent exception , schindler's list , eschewed color for some of the same reasons that raging bull did . ) in black-and-white ( especially considering scorsese's choice of shots and use of slow motion ) , the violence is stark and disturbing . there's no room for romanticism in the ring with inky black blood staining the canvas . during fight sequences , the director also uses a number of point-of-view shots designed to show the world , however briefly , from la motta's perspective . yet the director allows the film to run for thirty minutes after this pivotal moment , stretching more than a decade into la motta's future . the reason is obvious : scorsese isn't as interested in boxing as he is in the character . who cannot feel a surge of pity for la motta as he quietly recites marlon brando's speech from on the waterfront ? perhaps raging bull is indeed the best film of the '80s . and , if not , it's certainly perilously close to the zenith .

"though poetic justice was a misfire , boyz showed that singleton could tell a story , and after nearly ten years around stanford , one of the nation's hotbeds of multicultural experimentation , i knew that there were many stories to tell . higher learning shows that singleton recognized that fact as well ; unfortunately , he tried to tell them all in one movie . it's an ambitious but unfocused effort which is admirable for its balanced perspective but leaves critical characters as mere representations of the stereotypes it seems to be challenging . for fully half of its running time , higher learning appears to be headed in the right direction . unlike contemporaries oliver stone and spike lee , singleton does know how to present challenging and controversial subject matter without shouting at the top of his lungs in every frame . in a stone film , the hero's two mentors would be manifestations of good and evil ; singleton , on the other hand , makes both fudge and professor phipps smart and sensible characters , leaving the audience to draw its own conclusions . it doesn't hurt that both roles are played by magnetic screen presences . ice cube has true star potential , a powerful personality and a fine actor , and he keeps fudge from being simply a spouter of dogma . laurence fishburne's phipps doesn't really need a west indian accent , but he shows a genuine concern for malik , and also keeps his speeches from sounding didactic . malik's storyline is the most carefully plotted , and omar epps' fine performance as the young man weighing two views of being black in america makes it the most interesting to watch . but singleton fails to give his other two principles the same kind of depth . his story could have been an opportunity to examine why real , intelligent young people feel so threatened in a multi-cultural society , but he's pushed so far to the fringe that he becomes a cartoon . the problems with those two characters are representative of what is most wrong with higher learning , particularly in its second half . higher learning is awash in good intentions , but too often it's terribly simplistic , taking a story which should have been about the shaping of minds and reducing it to a matter of who's got the guns .",SRe

"only a year later , smith made a studio-financed follow-up called mallrats , a film so widely reviled that smith publicly apologized for it , announcing "" i don't know what i was thinking . "" though he sometimes explores his themes with more earnestness than clarity , smith gives chasing amy both a wicked sense of humor and a genuine sensitivity about the complications of sexual politics . for the first half-hour of chasing amy , kevin smith concentrates on churning out the laughs with his often-crude , usually pop-culture-heavy dialogue . he shows an admirable willingness to take on potentially thorny topics like gay stereotypes -- there's a great sequence involving a gay black comic book writer ( dwight ewell ) who is forced to keep up a public image as a militant afro-centrist -- and a conversation about archie and jughead as gay lovers works despite its forced tarantino-as-a-slacker quality . smith even pulls off a riff on jaws in which banky and alyssa compare wounds from oral sex horror stories like an emotionally immature richard dreyfuss and a lesbian robert shaw ( though the flashback literalization of those stories is ill-advised ) . while the jokes are rarely profound , they are usually effective and delivered with zing by the actors . it doesn't help that two of the longer speeches are delivered by joey lauren adams , a talented actress but one whose jennifer tilly voice becomes grating when emotional scenes force her to wail for several minutes at a time . smith clearly wants to stretch himself beyond satiric comedy , but he never quite finds a pace which gives the more serious moments in chasing amy a spark to match their sincerity . it's a shame smith's romantic observations never quite click as drama , because his ideas are far more intriguing than most of what is served up in contemporary romantic comedies . there is an impressive lack of judgmental posturing in the way smith develops his characters , and he shows keen insight into how different people respond to societal norms about sexual behavior . it's simply clear that smith is still a guy who writes like people sitting around talking , and that style works much better with comedy than with drama . when it is at its funniest , chasing amy reminds you why everyone was so high on kevin smith in the wake of clerks . and even when it falters as a drama , it proves that smith isn't content with making clerks over and over . or , perhaps more important , that he won't make mallrats over and over .",SRe
"screenplay : david sheffield , barry w . blaustein , tom shadyac , steve oedekerk . director : tom shadyac . if you ask most movie stars whether a given project is a "" comeback , "" they would probably insist that they were never away . in the case of eddie murphy , that's actually pretty close to the truth . _you_ may not have seen harlem nights , or the distinguished gentleman , or boomerang , or even beverly hills cop iii , but someone did -- over $300 million worth of someones , in fact . so no , eddie murphy never went anywhere ; it was only his ability to make people laugh which took a long vacation . i was beginning to wonder whether there was any of the old spark left in murphy , and then along comes the nutty professor . he still might have trouble identifying a decent script , but his talent is in full flower , including an unexpectedly broad acting range . murphy plays sherman klump , a brilliant chemistry professor with a bit of a weight problem -- about 400 lbs . worth . the result is a startling transformation of sherman klump into buddy love , a lean , mean testosterone machine who is every bit the party animal sherman never was . the lion's share of the pleasures in the nutty professor are pure eddie murphy , but not necessarily eddie murphy the way you are accustomed to seeing him . there are some big laughs in those family dinner scenes , particularly an extraordinarily embarrassing dinner with carla in attendance , although the flatulence gags are piled on a bit thick . but murphy is not coasting on his street-wise motor-mouth persona here , the persona which often seemed to be the only reason for dud projects like the golden child or the distinguished gentleman to exist . if anything , the nutty professor is a chance to poke fun at that persona through the hyper-slick buddy love . buddy is the arrogant , self-absorbed misogynist everyone probably believes murphy really is , and he knows enough to tweak that image for all he's worth . the real surprise is watching murphy sink his teeth into a real character , and do some real acting . murphy brings out that side as something endearing , and makes his shy , self-effacing manner terrifically appealing . i never thought i would see the day when eddie murphy would play a character who inspired sympathy , but watching klump disintegrate before a barrage of the comedian's barbs is genuinely poignant . murphy is so good that it's too bad he doesn't have better material to work with , or a more supportive supporting cast . for the most part , the script is all set-up with few truly inspired comic situations , relying on absurdist dream sequences and special effects for the big gags . there are moments when buddy love is on screen that you are waiting for murphy to run to the extreme , and ace ventura director tom shadyac just seems to be waiting for him to do something wacky . the script doesn't really give him the best opportunities , though , and he is playing off undeserving foils in jada pinkett and an uncomfortably edgy larry miller . murphy is trying to show what he can do here , and he is given material like the overly obvious homily at the film's conclusion which doesn't show trust in his abilities to convey emotion without spelling it all out . those abilities turn out to be what makes the nutty professor so much fun . welcome back , eddie , even if you never went away .",SRe

"inspired by the 1994 novel by william trevor , this is a film about a serial killer that promised to be more inspiring than it turned out , even though it is an excellently crafted film and has more to offer than the usual serial killer film does . it , somehow , takes a familiar journey down this director's path even if it seems the director is drifting off into foreign territory . the innovative canadian of armenian descent , atom egoyan , who has in the past covered such familiar themes as he does here , revisits the themes of betrayal , familial ills , religious conflicts , sexual secrets , videotapes , and uncertain identities . bob hoskins performance is brilliantly mannered , even if he chews the scenery to gain such control , but , nevertheless , he is engaging as a manipulative predator and someone who could be both charming and frightening . what fails this otherwise competent and worthwhile production , is that everything falls too easily into psychological place by the film's end . we are led to believe we understand too much about this serial killer and that he can be redeemed , but the reality is , that we understand too little about him , despite the appropriate effort that is made to understand him . when the nature of the relationship hoskins has in mind with felicia becomes obvious , the film can't recover from this knowledge and it becomes more natural for the audience to care that the angelic cassidy somehow survives what is intended her , rather than the film going into deeper and more unfamiliar ground . this serial killer film falls below the achievements of m and peeping tom , as it falls into the range of films that miss their mark but are still enriching .",DSc

"last year's it takes two is yet another cinematic retelling of mark twain's "" the prince and the pauper .

"the merchant ivory film a soldier's daughter never cries is a richly textured series of sketches pasted into an inviting , cinematic picture book . based on kaylie jones's novel of an expatriate family living in paris in the 1960s and 1970s , the story starts slowly as it introduces its characters , but it eventually weaves a strong spell on the audience . he voices controversial opinions that sometimes make sense and other times don't . except for these relatively weak characters , the movie is fully fleshed out . both actresses deliver wonderfully complex and winning performances . the realistic portrayal of channe's life and loves has incidents and characters just quirky enough to mimic real life without being too outlandish . the script by james ivory and ruth prawer jhabvala has the good sense to avoid the obvious scenes . instead , the script leads us into a heart-warming christmas tree trimming scene . the most original and intriguing character in the movie is the teenage channe's best friend , francis fortescue . francis , played by real-life operatic singer anthony roth costanzo in his first acting role , isn't channe's boyfriend per se , even if he'd like to be . his passion is opera , and his high-pitched voice is phenomenal . teenagers should all have such a wonderful friend as francis . having made us feel like part of the family , we become deeply but subtly moved by this last third of the picture . since they are viewed as weird , they act the part . the story , which gets to you in ways that are hard to explain , reminds us of the fragility of life and of the need to take the time to be with our loved ones , while they're still with us . and it teaches us about the need for friendships , both romantic and platonic . the first part of the film is partially in french with english subtitles . it is rated r for a little profanity and for mature situations and would be fine for teenagers .",SRh
"the selection of kilmer proved to be a wise one , but the biggest risk dreamworks took wasn't in the casting department . the radical departure was that they decided to use the medium of animation to make a biblical epic , a la cecil b . demille , to move our hearts and minds rather than to tickle our funny bones . in the press kit producer penney cox says that they wanted to make a film for adults based on sophisticated themes but one that did not exclude children . animated movies for adults that are appropriate for kids and that are not comedies , now that is something fresh . let me admit up-front that i was quite skeptical as to whether dreamworks could pull it off . dreamworks's antz seemed to be a movie not quite appropriate for any age group . the prince of egypt may be harder to market than antz , but it is much more satisfying . like antz and unlike the more modest casting of pixar's a bug's life , the prince of egpyt has half of hollywood doing the voices . you can figure out for yourself who does the voice of god . the movie , which is weakest in the story department , is a cliff's notes version of demille's the ten commandments . the script by kelly asbury and lorna cook has an obsession with touching briefly on every classic event in moses's life . at less than half of that , the prince of egypt rushes through so much material that it doesn't establish sufficient depth for us to bond with the characters . this leads to the classic scene of the parting of the red sea , which is one of many places where computers were used to enhance the traditionally hand-drawn animation of the most of the production . it is the absolutely stunning visuals that make the movie so compelling . drawn with a rich palette of luxurious roses , blues and golds , the picture looks sumptuous from its first frame to its last . the construction of the temple is shown in blowing dust , and other scenes are shot with the glow of a rising sun . the most original visual sequence in the film occurs during a dream moses has . done with an explicit two-dimensional look , the colorful images painted on the temple walls come to life to tell their own animated story . even though it has its weaknesses , the prince of egypt is a noble attempt to carve out a new genre -- serious animated movies for adults that are acceptable for the entire family . this awe-inspiring movie deserves to be seen . it is rated pg for thematic elements and would be fine for the whole family . how old a kid would need to be to be interested depends on the child , but those over 8 will probably like it .",SRh
"steven soderbergh's the limey is sort of an action crime-drama -- only there's not all that much action , and relatively little crime . it's sort of a character study -- only there's not a whole lot of the main character to study . it's sort of an avant garde experiment by soderbergh -- only soderbergh has been plenty more avant garde in the past . the limey keeps nudging you for artistic respect , and you keep thinking you might give it more if only it would stop nudging . intriguing films don't often feel as minimally satisfying as the limey . on the surface , it seems like it has plenty going for it ( though surface is one of the main things it does have going for it ) . i suspect the limey would have felt like a 25-year-too-late episode of "" mannix "" if soderbergh hadn't jolted the film's visual style . in effect , he turns most of the film into an extension on his clooney/lopez seduction sequence in out of sight -- flashing forward , flashing back , laying dialogue from one scene over images from another . it might have come off as simple gimmickry , if it weren't such an effective method of getting inside wilson's head . an ex-con in unfamiliar territory and coping with unresolved grief , he's living the jagged , stream-of-consciousness life soderbergh shows us on the screen . that's a wonderful start for an exploration of how a criminal comes to terms with the choices he has made and the effect of those choices on those in his life . and that's about as far as it goes . for all its moodiness and somber tones , the limey really isn't terribly interested in the complexities of its characters . terence stamp does a nice job as wilson , mixing a bit of introspection into the standard issue tough guy , but the introspection isn't as deep as all the mournful close-ups of stamp would suggest -- he's just , as they say in the self-help biz , looking for closure . guzman and warren are flat-out wasted as supporting players who barely have a chance to register , while fonda gets one or two decent moments as the fading tycoon . and you have to credit katt , because screenwriter lem dobbs doesn't seem otherwise keen on vivid personalities . it's not that the limey isn't an enjoyable piece of work . soderbergh is one of those directors who can give a mundane scene an electrifying twist , as in the unconventional way he films wilson's rampage at a downtown warehouse . the reason the limey never feels like a gritty vengeance caper , despite its car chases and shootouts , is that soderbergh is always yanking things 90 degrees from the expected direction . it would have made for an even better film , however , if it never felt like a gritty vengeance caper because it actually _wasn't_ a gritty vengeance caper . give soderbergh credity for the convincing illusion that this genre film is something else . stylistic flourishes aside , the limey is just a pretty darned good straight-ahead action crime-drama -- provided you like them with relatively little action , and not all that much crime . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .",SRe
"as written by victor hugo , the 19th century classic novel les miserables is a long , sprawling epic that encompasses everything from the political upheaval of post-revolutionary france to the intimate orchestrations of the heart . over the years , millions of fans have come to admire jean valjean , the book's protagonist , who proves that a man can change , and to adore cosette , the one girl who captures his heart . considering the book's length , which easily exceeds 1000 pages ( it is probably the second-longest novel i have ever read ) , there's no way that a 135-minute motion picture can begin to capture its vast scope ( nor , for that matter , can a 3-plus hour popular musical ) . nevertheless , while screenwriter's rafael yglesias makes a host of significant cuts , he manages not only to capture the essence of les miserables' key theme -- redemption -- but also to faithfully render the characters as more than one-dimensional condensations of their literary inspirations . as brought to the screen by neeson , valjean is not only a grand , heroic figure , but a distinctly human individual as well , with frailties aplenty . geoffrey rush , as dislikable here as he was likable as david helfgott in shine , makes javert a memorable villain , but he avoids the obvious temptation of turning the inspector into a cartoonish bad guy . as valjean has his failings , so javert has his virtues , and there are many times when we pity him more than hate him . it's an obsession that blinds javert to all else , and consumes his entire life . none of the supporting actors come close to matching neeson's quiet intensity or rush's zeal . uma thurman is surprisingly effective as fantine , but she's on-screen for less than a quarter of the film . given to overacting her most emotionally-charged scenes , danes seems wrong for the part . hans matheson , playing her love interest , is rather bland , but he is handicapped by an underwritten part . the marius of the movie is a pale shadow of the marius of the book , and the screen version of the love story is far from captivating . marius often seems more like a plot device than a genuine character . directed by bille august , who was once hand-picked by ingmar bergman to helm the best intentions , les miserables is a gloriously rich , if flawed , drama . the two-plus hours fly by as we are captivated by the characters and their circumstances . despite being condensed from a novel that would take 20 hours to present in its entirety , the film rarely has the feel of being rushed . it progresses briskly , but in such a manner that we never lose sight of the two-pronged emotional core of the story : valjean's rivalry with javert and his deep , abiding love for cosette . this is not , of course , the first motion picture version of les miserables , but it is one of the better ones , with a streamlined script that doesn't have the uneven feel of many of its predecessors . there's little doubt that the popularity of the musical made it easier to finance the movie , but anyone expecting singing and dancing will be in for a shock . and , while this version of les miserables lacks the cleverness and contemporary spin evident in claude lelouch's brilliant 1995 re-interpretation , it is moving and effective in its own right , as a more "" straightforward "" adaptation . kudos to all involved for a finely-crafted period drama that delivers over two hours of solid , literate entertainment .

"" even the magnificent , maleficent cruella is not safe from the onslaught of indignities , falling first into a vat of molasses and then into a pile of manure . it is a sign of hughes's love affair with "" america's funniest home videos "" humor that he replaces the original's most memorable suspense sequence -- the puppies' attempt to slip past cruella disguised as black labradors -- and replaces it with a scene in a barn which ends with a pig landing on cruella's chest . glenn close has obvious fun as cruella , playing her as an imperious drag queen , but i'm mystified by raves for her performance . there is no doubt that close can be scary -- she scared a generation of married men into zipping up their pants in fatal attraction -- but there is no malevolence in her characterization of cruella . disney's great villains were real threats , and they didn't take pratfalls ; cruella has horace and jasper so that _they_ can be the comic relief while she spooks the little ones . close cuts a fine figure in cruella's outrageous outfits and commanding some impressive sets , and she is about as intimidating as rupaul . then there are those adorable puppies . there is no point arguing that kids and many adults won't enjoy the frolicking dalmatians , because they will . there are a few marvelously trained animals in 101 dalmatians , and they provide some amusing moments . you could also get the same reaction out of most kids if you sat them down in front of a home movie of puppies playing , or an old episode of "" those amazing animals , "" or even a westminster dog show on espn2 , because reaction to the dogs in 101 dalmatians is not based on any kind of plot requiring individual personality for the animal characters . though the same kind of animatronic critters used in babe are used in 101 dalmatians , the animals don't talk here . not only does that make for some confusing narrative ( one scene found several kids around me perplexed as to why lucky was still in danger ) , but it makes the canine cast of 101 dalmatians little more than a big spotted blur . a certain kind of manipulative drama has long been called a "" tear-jerker , "" and 101 dalmatians is the family film equivalent . it's an "" awww-jeker , "" trotting out the adorable little puppies and having them yap at you until you begin to consider turning them into a coat yourself .",SRe
"writer and director gary ross , the writer and creator of big and dave , delights audiences once again with his best fantasy ever in pleasantville . like most teens , they blow all of this off , worrying more about their own popularity at school than the issues of the day . reese witherspoon delivers a dead-on performance as a sarcastic teen , who is aghast to be thrown into the plastic 1950s . the whole first half of the movie , as the kids cope and alter their new environment , is comedy at its best . intelligently written , the film's first part produces such a stream of laughter that you may need a second viewing to catch all the spoken humor and sight gags . breakfast , which is in danger of touching the ceiling , consists of stacks of dozens of pancakes , waffles , and toast . everything , absolutely everything , has always gone perfectly in pleasantville . like most television facades , there are a few things missing , like toilets in the bathroom stalls and words in the books , but the townsfolk don't mind . the movie explores change through the power of reading as well as sex . it is too bad that pleasantville had to come out the same year as the truman show since they will inevitably be compared . next to an almost perfect film like the truman show , pleasantville isn't as quite as good , having many fewer memorable lines for one and lacking the talent of a jim carrey for another , but this should not be allowed to detract from the incredible brilliance of pleasantville . as dazzlingly filmed by john lindley in a gorgeous black and white , the movie slowly develops color in small places like roses and tongues , until it bursts into a bouquet of saturated colors by the end . how and why things turn color is one of the mysteries that the story slowly reveals . at first the reason seems simple and almost trite , and then the complete rationale behind the colorization becomes the story's key turning point . visually it is a stunning technical achievement . once color appears in this innovative film , women's make-up is shown to be able to take on an entirely different role . starting as a hilarious comedy , the story transforms carefully into a serious satire on life's insanities . although it starts off as a romp , the film ends up with more messages than you can count , all of them delivered delicately but powerfully . part science fiction , the story asks the age-old question of what would happen to the future if you could alter the past ? moreover , would the results be what you expect and want ? david worries about this a lot , but jennifer is more interested in freeing the people from their chains and the consequences be damned . the movie contains many great small performances . the story has many surprises . you yell "" cat !

"the simple message this one-note film envisions , is that one should never be who they are not . the debut feature of jamie babbit is unabashedly awkward and to make matters worse , she can't get the cast to stop mugging for the camera . the comedy was lame , the characters were not interesting , only the idea was good if it could have been developed into a story with more dimensions than the one it belabored . the stupidity of trying to force someone against their will from being a homosexual , is treated as a heavy-handed 'saturday night live' satire routine . there was not enough of a story for it to be released as a movie . it was painful to watch this kind of kitsch for 80 or so minutes , which seemed to drag on for a hellish eternity . it is just as tortorous watching this film as it probably is going through such an indoctrination program . he is also the groundskeeper making sexual gestures with his chain-saw , who camps it up to the point of going over-the-top , losing all proportion for his character as being anything but a cartoon figure . his exaggerated gait and suppresed gay tendencies never materialized as funny stuff , just a bad script he was stuck with which was made more unbearable by his obnoxious performance . all the boys in the camp were sorry sights , offering neither comedy nor concern for them . clea is the only one in the film who belonged in this film and made the most of her role , making it believable as the rich bitchy girl who knows damn well that she's a lesbo , but also knows that if she doesn't go through with this farce of a rehab program , her parents will take away the trust fund she stands to inherit . the absurdity of the film is highlighted in its loud set designs , as the girls are overwhelmed with garish pink and tangerine colored outfits and room furnishings , while the boys are furnished with this hideous bright blue color . the other absurdity is in how artificial the planned steps are and how meaningless it is to graduate from a program such as this one . this is not a good campy film , and to the bargain , after trying to get laughs for the first half of the film , it then starts to take itself seriously . but the theme is so absurd , that there really is no message that can be delivered . everything about it is strained . she seemed to be going for the hammy sweetness she thought her role required and when the comedy part of the film was over and she had hot pants for graham , there was no spark on the screen to give the affair any life . it all seemed manufactured , leaving the film telling its joke to an audience they believe will be sympathetic . the problem with that is , the one-note joke ran dry a long time ago . i just couldn't wait for the film to end . if you are going to make a campy b movie , then it takes more than crudeness and over-the-top performances to make it funny . i'll take my campy film with no pretenses to art . . . let it be a film that is bitingly hilarious ( ok , just funny will do ) .",DSc
"as economically directed by erik skjoldbaerg , insomnia , the lean and atmospheric tale written by nikolaj frobenius , is not compelled to explain everything . although it's not hard to follow , the story happily leaves the actions and motivations of many of the characters ambiguous . a film without much dialog like insomnia requires a strong leading actor to carry it . stellan skarsgard from breaking the waves , good will hunting and ronin delivers a masterful performance as jonas engstrom , the swedish cop with a reputation for doing whatever it takes to crack a case . skarsgard's acting temperament makes him a perfect choice for the role of the stoic policeman . racked with guilt for his mistakes and fearing the worst , jonas pushes his body past its level of endurance , causing himself , more than once , to almost fall asleep at the wheel . erling thurmann-andersen's penetrating cinematography shows every pore and line in jonas's troubled face . the director pays careful attention to the small details . the background sounds , for example , are so low that even a kiss sounds like a small explosion . this lack of ambient noise allows him to emphasize the minutia of the case that might otherwise have been missed . to say that a movie makes you sleepy is generally the ultimate insult , but not this time . skarsgard delivers such an emphatic performance that audiences may begin to feel just as fatigued as jonas . insomnia runs just 1 : 37 . the film is in norwegian with english subtitles . it is not rated but would be an r for brief intense gore , sex , nudity and profanity and would be fine for teenagers .",SRh
"united states , 1997 ( original 1980 ) release date : 5/21/80 ( wide ) special edition release date : 2/21/97 ( wide ) running length ( special edition ) : 2 : 06 mpaa classification : pg ( mild violence ) theatrical aspect ratio : 2 . 35 : 1 indulge me for a moment as i time travel back to 1980 . but , for science fiction movie lovers , there was only one event : the may 21 opening of the empire strikes back . the movie was a guaranteed success before its first public show . although it lacks the pioneering "" newness "" of star wars , the empire strikes back is in many ways a superior motion picture . the storyline is more interesting and ambitious , the characters -- little more than appealing types in the original -- are allowed to grow and develop , the special effects are more mature , and the tone is deliciously dark and downbeat . it's the latter quality that has made the empire strikes back the least favorite among young star wars fans -- excepting yoda , there's nothing cute to be found , and the film definitely doesn't leave viewers with a warm , fuzzy feeling . in the first film , good triumphed decisively over evil ; here , it's almost the other way around . for the special edition , lucas has chosen to do considerably less re-engineering than he did with star wars , which is evidence that empire , as originally presented , was close to his vision . the soundtrack has been digitally beefed up , a few new scenes have been inserted ( including some extended shots of the wampa ice creature's attack ) , and certain effects sequences have been noticably enhanced ( the millenium falcon's approach to the cloud city being the most obvious ) . in general , however , the changes to empire are less obvious than those to star wars , which were subtle enough in their own right . there's nothing in the special edition that changes the scope , quality , or intent of the film . it's a little bigger , a little brighter , and a little louder . the movie does not pick up where star wars left off . in terms of the mythological antecedents that lucas based much of his star wars trilogy on , there was nothing startling about vader's origins , but , considering the darkness it would inevitably inject into the series , it was a bold stroke . the scenes that begin with the luke/vader lightsaber duel and end with the young hero's despairing decision to allow himself to plummet out of vader's reach represent the most compelling sequence offered by any of the three movies . the structure of the empire strikes back is more complex than the relatively linear path traversed by star wars . instead of keeping the heroes together , as was the case in the first film , lucas , along with director irvin kershner and screenwriters leigh brackett and lawrence kasdan , elects to split them up . everything comes together at the end , and there's a reunion of sorts , but the empire strikes back concludes with so many unanswered questions that it's tantamount to a cliffhanger . all of the primary actors are more relaxed here than in star wars . harrison ford , easily the most successful of the three leads outside of star wars , shows obvious improvement , honing his cynical-but-lovable performance to a fine edge . the visual effects in the empire strikes back are far more impressive than those of star wars . from the approach of the imposing imperial walkers to the escape from the cloud city , there's a lot here to delight the eye . likewise , john williams' score , which uses multiple cues from star wars , displays the richness and maturity necessary for a darker , more operatic motion picture . because of the high quality of the original product , it doesn't show a hint of dating . neither the first nor the third chapters ( or , properly , the "" fourth "" and "" sixth "" ) of the star wars saga were able to match the narrative scope of empire , which today remains one of the finest and most rousing science fiction tales ever committed to the screen .",JBe
"what would happen , i wonder , if frank capra was still alive and making films today ? would his unique blend of feel-good optimism and old-fashioned values be accepted by jaded movie-going audiences that increasingly seem to suffer from attention deficit syndrome ? or , can capra only be appreciated today in black-and-white , as a reminder of what films used to be during "" simpler times ? "" of course , there's the other side of the coin to consider , as well -- a film trying to recapture capra's style could easily end up going over-the-top into saccharine melodrama . the ending , with its obvious nod to it's a wonderful life , mines a vein of goodwill and uplifting sentiment , and , as a result , may seem a little corny and behind-the-times to all but the most uncynical of viewers . so the cotlers have taken a risk in making this sort of movie in 1998 . ultimately , the risk might have paid off more handsomely had there not been several obvious production problems . heartwood , although rooted in the soil of good intentions , is flawed . the film is basically a modern day fairy tale with a happy ending , and , for a movie like this to be entirely successful , it must be crafted with great care and attention to detail . heartwood suffers from sketchily-developed characters that seem real and believable only about half the time . worse still , several key scenes are undermined by uneven acting . the plot of heartwood combines three different elements into one story . the first , and least-inspired , is a fairly traditional boy- meets-girl romance . the third , and most consistently interesting , deals with the struggles of a saw mill owner to balance environmental concerns with his desperate need for money . the cotlers express this aspect of their film subtly , by making the forest a strong presence -- almost to the point where it functions as a supporting character . aspects of heartwood work exceptionally well . the cinematography is glorious , running a close second to the horse whisperer for the most stunning views of sunrises and sunsets to come across the screen this year . the film also offers insight into the fascinating workings of a community whose entire existence is entwined with the success of a saw mill . i especially liked one character's rationalization for cutting down trees : "" it's survival of the fittest . "" there are also a number of effectively-realized character moments , such as one where frank offers to brush sylvia's hair as they share a quiet moment . unfortunately , there are instances when the plot's preposterous turns are highlighted ( rather than camouflaged ) by the overwrought performances of the two leads . eddie mills and hilary swank ( the new karate kid ) are fine when they're not required to depict powerful emotions , but , on those occasions when the script demands passion , tears , rage , or some equally heartfelt display , their performances become awkward and unconvincing , and this hurts heartwood's believability . several of the other actors , including jason robards , john terry , and especially denise dummont ( who stands out despite limited screen time ) , are quite good , but their effective portrayals are overshadowed by the unevenness exhibited by mills and swank . in many ways , heartwood reminded me of 1996's the spitfire grill . although i think the cotlers' film is somewhat less manipulative and true-to-itself , there are similarities in tone and intent . heartwood's great strength is its ability to fold an intelligent message seamlessly into the story ; its weakness is that the narrative is hurt , rather than helped , by the performances . it's possible to appreciate this kind of film for the way it recalls capra's spirit ; it's just not strong enough to evade the labels of "" melodramatic "" and "" corny .

"it is said that every man or woman has at least one story to tell ; this is duvall's . the actor filled nearly every role imaginable on this production ? in addition to financing it , he starred in it , directed it , executive produced it , and wrote it . for duvall , the apostle is not just a movie , it is * the * movie . a relatively simple tale about a far-from-simple character , the apostle never falters in its portrayal of euliss "" sonny "" dewey ( duvall ) as a real , flesh-and-blood human being . it does not patronize or satirize . it is respectful without being reverential . the apostle is a character study , and , like all motion pictures of this sort , its ultimate success depends upon how compelling the protagonist is . as essayed by duvall , arguably one of america's ten-best living actors , sonny is the kind of complex individual we could watch for hours on end without ever losing interest . like many flawed heroes , sonny is a good man who is haunted by one tragic mistake . sonny has moments of weakness , but his sincerity never wavers , even when his ministry flourishes and the temptation for self-aggrandizement grows . watching sonny lead revivals , it's easy to understand the appeal of an energetic preacher , and how some of the most popular achieve a status not unlike that of a rock star . it is a testimony to duvall's reputation in the business that he was able to gather such an impressive cast for a low-budget , low-profile motion picture . in his long and distinguished career , only his oscar-winning performance in 1983's tender mercies was this raw . the energy and passion of a preacher are all present . duvall has devoted a great deal of time and effort into getting the details right . to enhance the apostle's verisimilitude , he relied primarily on non-professional church-goers and evangelists ( rather than experienced actors ) in supporting roles . for the picture's style , he admits to being inspired by the near-documentary quality of ken loach's films . as a result , the apostle possesses a truer and more intimate feel than it would have with slick camerawork . the apostle is not the kind of movie that provokes a profound change in the viewer , but it offers a balanced portrait of a unique personality . sonny is not easily forgotten and , when the oscar nominations are announced , it's possible that duvall won't be , either . - ingmar bergman",JBe
"it was produced and directed by wolfgang petersen of das boot and in the line of fire fame . this is a director who knows how to create great tension that really grabs the audience's attention and holds it through out the entire movie . he is also a master at action sequences and the military helicopter scenes in this flick were evidence of his abilities as well as that of the cinematographer . it works so fast that if you are not dead in twenty-four hours after being exposed , you are safe . this germ detective story is excellent and the pacing is good so that your eyes stay glued to the screen . go to the bathroom before entering , you don't want to miss any of the details . it is complex and yet quite easy to follow . outbreak at its best was almost as good . petersen is a master director . after seeing this movie , i should warn you that you may never want to fly in airplanes again . you certainly will find yourself leaving any theater where someone coughs . sad to say , we also learn from the beginning that there is a subplot in the show that is going to have us believe that our military has some covert operations of massively evil proportions going on . without this ridiculous and unnecessary sojourn into again lambasting our own generals , the movie had a perfectly plausible ring to it . the acting was uneven . dustin hoffman , whom i have not seen in many movies recently , stars as the military chief of biological research . hoffman delivers star quality work . also excellent in the show was hoffman's sidekick played by cuba gooding jr . he played the aggressive green recruit character in fresh and interesting ways . rene russo who was so excellent in petersen's last show , in the line of fire , was given a poorly written part as hoffman's domestic counterpart--the head of germ research at the cdc . russo's acting was not credible and moreover , i would just as soon have seen her whole part eliminated . the germ research had the energy to stand on its own and did not need a romantic second subplot to add excitement to the movie . another tragedy of the film was the wasting of morgan freeman as hoffman's commanding general . this was the weakest character freeman has ever been asked to play--very one dimensional . this brilliant actor ( glory , driving miss daisy , the shawshank redemption , etc . ) did not seem to care about the show and gave a pedestrian performance . finally , the less said about donald sutherland's part as the major general who was freeman's boss , the better . both characters were cliches that should not have been in a movie of this caliber . outbreak runs an exciting 2 : 00 . it is rated r for bleeding eyeballs and other makeup effects that you see on halloween masks . there was a 10 year old behind me that loved the movie . i recommend this tension filled detective story to everyone above the age of about 9 , and i award it  . absent the unnecessary diabolical military subplot , i would have been able to give the movie another half star .",SRh

"this comedy/romance story is more about the sense of communication than it is about the mystery story or about the five senses the structure of its story is built around . it is done in a delicately stylized form , filmed mostly in dark , somber shades , as the story revolves around the characters in an office/residential building in toronto . the film moves along at a brisk pace , which kept me interested in their lives , but what the story failed to do was tell me all it can about the characters . nevertheless , i was satisfied with the film and the very sensitive nature it tapped into , as it touched a nerve in each one's character and left me caring about them , despite thinking that maybe the characters were a bit shallow . this engrossing film touches on the fears people have who are losing their senses and how they must rely on the sense that is their strongest to pull them through their difficulties . rona struggles to understand herself through the sense of taste that is both her strong and weak point . they are seen slyly talking to each other about what to avoid in a relationship , since they have both experienced many failed ones they have much in common . this sequence didn't have the flow to it the others did , and even though it was touching to see , it seemed too calculated to have much of an affect . jeremy podeswa ( eclipse ) , the writer-director , has come up with a captivating film despite the shallowness of the characters and the story being a landmine full of clich ? s . there are things shown in the relationships uncovered that bring out so many emotional qualities , as this independent film takes risks on a story line that borders on being perceived as too arty , but somehow it works because it has something to say about relationships that are so painful to bear . that i didn't get to know as much about the characters as i would have liked , gets overridden by how well the story was presented . i don't think the film would have worked if it weren't for the nuanced ways of the film and if it tried to tidy up everyone's life by the finale . the point being made , is that it is the small little things one does to stimulate one's senses that counts the most , whether it is when one reaches out for another , or when just trying to understand someone else and giving them succor , that it is by using one's senses to connect with someone else that makes life worth living . these revelations were too banal to make this more than an intriguing film . but , the story did catch and hold my interest .",DSc

"berlinger and sinofsky painstakingly chronicle ten months worth of developments , illustrating how easily justice can be swayed . there's no way that this movie can answer the question of the defendants' guilt or innocence , but one piece of information is clear from paradise lost : jessie misskelly , damien echols , and jason baldwin did not receive fair trials . because damien was "" different "" by his own admission -- he wore black , listened to metallica , and had shown interest in the wicca religion -- he made an excellent target . berlinger and sinofsky have obtained an amazingly in-depth and intimate picture of the situation . as a result , there are no faceless entities here -- all of the participants have personalities . suddenly , the documentarians were no longer detached observers , but participants . and , while it's unlikely that their "" contribution "" affected the outcome , it's impossible to say for certain . ultimately , however , when you consider the nature of paradise lost's main concerns , this matter is of secondary importance . arthur miller's the crucible , which is due in theaters this fall , offers the salem witch trials as a parallel to mccarthyism . paradise lost shows that witch hunts didn't end centuries , or even decades , ago . the mere hint of satanism doomed their cases , even if their only real crimes were listening to heavy metal music , wearing strange clothing , and holding unconventional beliefs . there's much about these three that we'll never know , but the scary thing is that the men and women of west memphis don't care about those gaps . truth has become far less important than closure . and it doesn't matter that , if these boys are innocent , the real killers are still free . no documentary released in 1996 challenges an audience the way this one does . the questions it proposes are profound , and there are no answers . paradise lost is one of a very few films that completely absorbs the attention . watching berlinger and sinofsky's movie is like witnessing an execution : it's horrifying , gut-wrenching , and impossible to turn away from . paradise lost is the kind of film that will leave even the most devout defendants of the legal system either shaken or shaking their heads . -- ingmar bergman",JBe
"ralph fiennes is carving out a nice niche for himself in the genre of period piece romances . despite some obvious overplotting , oscar and lucinda is a mostly effective and often affecting motion picture that touches our hearts while daring our minds to balk at its implausible coincidences . yet one characteristic unites these two diverse individuals -- the compulsion to gamble , whether it's on horses , dogs , cards , or the flip of a coin . but oscar is uncertain of lucinda's affection , and feels he must do something to prove himself worthy of her . oscar and lucinda isn't beyond a little manipulation to get the desired emotional response , and there are times when the storyline curves in preposterous directions . on more than one occasion , it's apparent that events are occurring specifically to funnel the characters into a position where there is only one possible route . coincidence is a crucial plot device ; without it , this movie can't go anywhere .

"take the mentality of an old-fashioned hollywood western , bleed in elements from kevin costner's dances with wolves , and start it out with a sequence culled from the fugitive , and you get the last of the dogmen--a surprisingly entertaining , somewhat corny adventure film . and , while there's an obviously politically-correct slant to the story , that does nothing to dilute the last of the dogmen's enjoyability . the movie isn't as accomplished as dances with wolves , but it doesn't have either the length or quite the same aspirations . it's not really all that complicated a story , but someone from savoy pictures disagreed , and the result is an extremely irritating voiceover read by an uncredited wilford brimley . i'm not fond of this method of storytelling in the best of circumstances , but this is easily the most intrusive and redundant narration in years . the last of the dogmen would have been vastly improved without it . just as you're really getting into the story , brimley's voice pops up to interrupt the flow . nevertheless , occasional plot contrivances aside , the last of the dogmen succeeds on several levels . despite a two-hour running length , the movie keeps the audience's attention . berenger and hershey work well together , and their budding romance remains low-key . the cinematography is gorgeous , with effective use of the exhilarating mountain scenery . it's almost possible to believe that a lost tribe could exist undetected out in that wilderness . and a shot of a high-flying airplane , reminding us that this is 1995 , is a nice touch . writer/director tab murphy pokes occasional fun at the macho cowboy image while simultaneously embracing it through berenger's scruffy lewis . this simple theme lies at the core of an adventure that , while not original , is nevertheless satisfying . the last of the dogmen may recall dances with wolves , but it seems less a copy than a different story taking a similar path .",JBe

"he has been at his craft for more than 30 years now -- his debut , chafed elbows , came out in 1965 . three decades of film making haven't dulled downey's edge , and , in 1997 , he's back with a terrific new feature -- an upbeat , quirky romantic comedy that reminds us just how stale most entries into this genre are . but hugo pool , called by its creator a "" comedy with serious relief "" isn't just fun and games . for downey , there's another , deeply personal side to the film . true to his nature , however , downey never gets maudlin or preachy about the subject . the love aspect of hugo pool involves hugo and floyd , and it's touching , sweet , and funny . despite floyd's considerable disability , the attraction between the two grows as the film progresses , eventually reaching a satisfying conclusion . patrick dempsey , whose character can't move or talk , does all of his acting with his face and eyes . alyssa milano , whose resume includes several b-grade exploitation flicks , is a real revelation . as hugo , she's great -- tough , energetic , and charming . the supporting cast is top-notch . malcolm mcdowell does his best jimmy cagney accent while portraying an ex-druggie with an unusual method of therapy . like david mamet and relative newcomer quentin tarantino , downey writes some of the best dialogue around , and his script sparkles with it . his words aren't the kind of things real people would say , but they have a rhythm and charm all their own . characters make comments like "" chances are taken , not given , "" "" i'm too superficial to be hurt , "" and "" if words could speak , i still would have nothing to say .

"while the movie explores serious issues , it often does so in a playful , even comic , manner . there's a greek chorus of drag queens on hand to lip-synch old pop tunes that fit the current mood ( some of these numbers recall similar moments from the adventures of priscilla , queen of the desert ) . the script is peppered with biting one-liners and amusing anecdotes . depicted from another point-of-view , stonewall could have been a real downer . as it stands , however , finch has made this an upbeat , triumphant tale . la miranda is typical of the new york transvestite scene -- tough , hardened , and jaded . certainly , the most fascinating aspect of stonewall is its depiction of the gay culture thirty years ago . as homophobic as this nation is today , '90s views are nothing compared to those prevalent in the late-'60s . they willingly fostered the belief that homosexuality was an illness , courting pity in the hope that it would supplant hatred . stonewall is not intended to be a history lesson ; the time frame and setting are necessary to the story , but they are subordinate to the characters . some of the subplots work ; some don't . the believability of these two anchors the film , preventing stonewall from ever becoming too outrageous or seeming too preachy . we sympathize with the cause not because of rhetoric , but because we care about the characters . undoubtedly , that's one reason why this motion picture succeeds . another is that , in addition to having a heart , stonewall isn't afraid to have fun , which is a welcome change from the agenda of many grim , gay-themed motion pictures currently floating around the international film festival circuit .",JBe

"their latest offering is something called china moon , a film noir featuring the unlikely pairing of ed harris with madeleine stowe . this movie , which bears a 1991 date , is not like a fine wine--age has not improved it ( in fact , in the three-plus years since it was filmed , ms . stowe has gone to some lengths to distance herself from the production ) . after exchanging a few bad lines of dialogue , rachael and kyle recognize the attraction , although they don't act on it--at least not immediately . as far as thrillers go , this one starts off dead in the water . the first forty minutes are not only dull , but dull in a manner that calls attention to the bad dialogue and obvious plot points . there are instances when the relevance of some little detail is called attention to by everything except a big neon sign saying : "" look ! the second half of china moon almost redeems the first . despite numerous coincidences designed to stretch one's suspension of disbelief to the breaking point , and several truly dumb plot contrivances , it's actually fun to follow all the twists and turns--even if too many of them are predictable . the ending , which displays a willingness to try something a little different , is another source of potential forgiveness . then there are the actors . if you don't listen to 75% of the dialogue ( which sounds like it was written by a seventh-grader hooked on dime-store potboilers ) , the two leads give enjoyable performances . ed harris is generally convincing , as is madeleine stowe , although it should be pointed out that neither role demands a great deal of range . these are pretty much single-dimension performances : the strong , silent detective and the scared , abused wife . on the other hand , the supporting cast doesn't have a clue . charles dance gets into his role as the detestable husband , never once eliciting a glimmer of sympathy from the audience , but his performance seems almost clinical--a sort of act-by-numbers job with a very , very bad southern accent . benicio del toro is absolutely dreadful , and almost every scene that he's in turns into an endurance contest for those watching . basically , for anyone who just wants to see a truly convoluted thriller without considering the logic or intelligence of the serpentine track of the story , china moon isn't a terrible choice . the film is good only by b-movie standards , and as such it offers something in the way of lowbrow entertainment . enjoyability depends largely on how deeply the viewer can immerse him- or herself in the movie's murky waters--something that's an iffy prospect with the combination of mr . del toro's acting and screenwriter roy carlson's often-inane script .",JBe

"fargo takes the usual "" caper gone wrong "" storyline and applies a new twist . even so , the finished product still bears several of their unmistakable trademarks , including atypical humor and an unmistakable visual flair . in many ways , fargo is a departure for the coens . their previous films , especially blood simple , miller's crossing , barton fink , and the hudsucker proxy , were stylistic treats , filled with offbeat characters and amazing images . fargo , on the other hand , is a more restrained picture . perhaps because it is based on non-fictional events , the coens decided to tone down their approach . cinematographer ( and long-time coen collaborator ) roger deakins relies primarily on traditional shots , and the characters are designed to be more "" normal . "" a current of absurd humor runs through fargo . even though the story is based on true events , it's hard to take certain aspects of this movie seriously . the problem with fargo is that there aren't any substantial characters . everyone , from the overwrought jerry to the methodical marge , is a pure caricature . none of these people are particularly interesting or sympathetic , and watching their exploits becomes a detached experience . by the end of the film , you're more interested in how the filmmakers choose to tie together loose ends than whether any particular individual lives or dies . in the past , the coens have managed to create characters worth caring about ; such is not the case here , and it greatly diminishes fargo's effectiveness . people say things like "" you're darn tootin' "" , "" aw , geez , "" and "" what the heck "" . knowing how strange the talk of minnesotans will seem to the rest of the world , the coens intentionally play it for deadpan comic effect . it's easy to admire what the coens are trying to do in fargo , but more difficult to actually like the film . the absence of viable characters limits any dramatic impact , making this more of an intellectual exercise than a complete motion picture experience .",JBe

"it seems that hardly a year goes by without a new cinematic adaptation of one of shakespeare's plays , and , of late , kenneth branagh's name has become intimately entwined with that of the bard . while branagh , who helmed henry v , much ado about nothing , and is now working on hamlet , does not sit in the director's chair for this latest version of othello , he is very much in evidence on screen in the key role of iago . to condense othello into a reasonable , two-hour running time , writer/director oliver parker has lopped approximately 50% of shakespeare's original text from the screenplay . yet , even with so much gone , the movie remains faithful to the play's central themes and conflicts , and the streamlined narrative is surprisingly easy to follow ( well , as "" easy "" as anything written by shakespeare can be ) . for sheer impact , this othello can stand side-by-side with the versions brought to the screen by orson welles ( as restored in 1992 ) and lawrence olivier . othello's "" tragic flaw "" is his jealousy , and it's this quality that iago exploits with his complex scheme . much of the audience's ability to identify with the characters is dependent upon the trio of central performances that grace othello . it's an entirely different experience to read the play or see a live performance than it is to view a cinematic rendition . the visual aspects of parker's production are especially noteworthy . othello is dark , and makes creative use of light and shadow as only a motion picture can . laurence fishburn , a black actor playing the black title role ( in some of his various other film incarnations , othello has been essayed by the likes of orson welles , lawrence olivier , and anthony hopkins ? none of whom are black ) , gives a stirring and powerful interpretation of a man haunted by uncertainty about his wife's faithfulness . kenneth branagh , perhaps better focused since he's only acting in this piece , makes iago a chillingly rational character whose acerbic asides to the camera draw the audience into his plot almost as an accomplice . certain shakespeare purists will probably dismiss parker's othello because of its sex scenes and liberal cuts . such a reaction might be a mistake , however , since this director's view of othello's tragedy has an unusual slant . parker is careful to play up the love affair between the title character and his wife so that when the inevitable occurs , it has a more profound impact . when othello declares , "" my life upon [desdemona's] faith "" , you believe him . with this version of othello , parker wanted to create a shakespearean film that anyone could see , relate to , and enjoy ? a degree in english literature not being required . in large part , he has accomplished this . othello has never been one of my favorite of the bard's plays , but , at times , i found myself engrossed by this adaptation . using the visual aspects of film to enhance certain story elements , parker has crafted a fine motion picture .",JBe

"" belle epoque , the winner of nine goyas ( spanish oscars ) , is a charming motion picture that requires only enough thought and concentration to read the subtitles . as a diversion , the film is fabulous . how it managed to win the best foreign language film oscar ( especially over a contender like farewell my concubine ) is another matter altogether . it is 1931 . some of issues presented by the tumultuous political climate and the churning waters of religious uncertainty keep belle epoque from being a completely brainless endeavor . nevertheless , anything serious is kept strictly in the background , and even the most dismal scenes are presented with enough playfulness to avoid betraying the giddy tone . with a minimum of nudity , belle epoque demonstrates that the blatant displays of flesh from something like sirens are unnecessary to set an atmosphere of sensuality . this is a steamy motion picture with its share of bed-hopping and partner-swapping . all six major characters are nicely-developed and well-portrayed . despite the numerous sexual trysts he engages in , fernando is still something of an innocent , and jorge sanz plays him to wide-eyed perfection . the most complex character of all is manolo , who is based on a real-life acquaintance of producer/director fernando trueba . the character's own words describe him best : "" i am a rebel , an infidel , and a libertine by nature , living life like a scared old bourgeois . "" very little of the humor in belle epoque is especially high-brow--in fact , much of it is quite earthy . more important than the nature of the comedy , however , is that it successfully provokes laughter . as was the intention of fernando trueba when he crafted the film , the ultimate reaction of the audience is to smile . despite the subtitles , this is less art than it is fun .",JBe
"at the 1998 sundance film festival , writer/director boaz yakin commented that a price above rubies isn't so much specifically about life in the hasidic jewish community as it is about "" being an individual in any society where conformity and tradition dominate . "" the story could just as easily have taken place in the amish country , apparently , or in any other highly conservative culture . in a cinematic era of hot air and gimmickry , it's hard to fault a film-maker when he's trying to tell a story _about_ something . unfortunately for yakin , beginning with a theme doesn't work when the cultural atmosphere is as crucial to a story as hasidic judaism is to a price above rubies . you can feel the world shifting constantly within her , conveyed through the naked emotionalism of zellweger's performance . it's a movie set with costumes and props , into which sonia might just as well have been dropped like an alien into a spielbergian american suburb . yakin commits himself so thoroughly to making sonia a genuinely complex character that he doesn't take the time to fill in the background . it certainly doesn't help that some of the blind-to-a-fault casting stretches credulity to the breaking point . british actor christopher eccleston chews on his new yawk accent as though he were about to blow a bubble with it , while creating a borderline melodramatic rendition of manipulative villainy . if you want to distill what doesn't work in a price above rubies into two words , try to imagine renee zellweger convincingly uttering the magic words , "" oy gevalt .

"malice is a well-crafted , intelligently-scripted thriller that is perhaps a bit too slick to be considered film noire , but is nevertheless hitchcockian in intent . the movie breaks free of the mold that so many of its genre have lately fallen into , that of a seemingly-helpful friend/neighbor/nanny/police officer/whatever turning out to be a wacko . malice has a little more class than that . there are quite a few twists and turns in the plot , some of which aren't that difficult to figure out , but a few that are likely to take the viewer unawares . make no mistake : the intent of this movie is to surprise the audience , and it succeeds fairly well at that . while it's true that in the aftermath of malice , careful thought will reveal some logical flaws in the script , these aren't nearly as noticeable during the action . the plot has some structural problems resulting from trying to do a bit too much for the running time . there are also several scenes and plot threads that , while interesting , ultimately have nothing to do with the story . the inclusion of these is more odd than frustrating , however . the unusual genesis of the script might have something to do with the irrelevance of some of what appears . this was before a few good men had made the transition from play to film . so , although the shooting script came from sorkin's pen , it included numerous elements of both his own and frank's versions . considering the number of cooks involved in this broth , it's amazing that the final product is so polished . scott frank's involvement immediately makes one think of dead again , but this movie is closer to shattered in execution--the plot twists aren't nearly as well-camouflaged as in the kenneth branagh-directed thriller . that is only one of a few standout scenes , all but one of which feature baldwin . the acting is uniformly good , with appearances by anne bancroft ( who is wonderful ) and george c . scott ( who is solid , but nothing to write home about ) . baldwin loves this kind of role , and nicole kidman shows that she's capable of being more than tom cruise's on- and off-screen love interest . bill pullman is the weakest of the trio , but he gets better as the film progresses . jerry goldsmith turns in a surprisingly spare score , more reminiscent of bernard hermann's hitchcock material than his own overblown basic instinct music . it's a pleasure not to be bombarded by blasts of music any time something dramatic is about to happen . goldsmith deserves credit for this . there are movies that demand loud , bombastic themes , but this is not one of them , and the composer recognized this . occasionally there's a diamond in the rough like dead again , but mostly these films are dreary , predictable , and utterly uninteresting--entirely the opposite of what the word "" thriller "" means . while malice won't win any awards , it's a cut above the average . yes , there are hollywood conventions in it , but the movie also keeps the intelligent viewer in mind . while the final result is something of a curious mixture , it's ultimately one that provides a source of entertainment .",JBe

"a mindless action film that exploits the current news headlines while it presents andy warhol's dictum that , in the future , everybody will be famous for 15 minutes , and adds to that its ludicrous plot revolving around how everyone is enchanted by fame , either wanting to be a celebrity or to gawk at them . it also presents an annoyingly didactic message about violence encouraged by the media for ratings and of criminals getting away with murder because they know how to bend the rules , as its maddening story only worsens with an incoherent finale . there is nothing subtle about this heavy-handed thriller . the good part of the film is its fast-paced street action scenes and the attention grabbing psychopathic villain ( karel roden ) challenging the self-absorbed celebrity ace homicide detective ( de niro ) , which makes for vulgar entertainment . it's a film that has about 15 minutes of fervor to it before it gets grounded into a mixture of sleaze , violence , and heartless melodrama . emil will at one point declare : "" i love america ! the only good thing about this arrangement , is that despite its seamly nature , eddie is a dedicated and good cop , and the show does help in catching criminals . other than the action scenes brilliantly filmed by jean yves escoffier , the movie is unappealing . as for the actors : de niro is playing a part he always does very well , showing off his comical gift for quirkiness and endowing his character with a larger than life presentation . burns is his opposite , a bland personality , who doesn't watch tv or seek publicity , and the performance succeeds only in being a bland one , intentional or not . the juiciest part is reserved for roden , who makes the most out of being a scary figure , a sociopath with an unintentionally droll wit . he could be any one of a number of tabloid tv slimy hosts , reminding me most of the ass kissing geraldo rivera . there's not much to this flick , except for the beautiful way its mayhem was filmed . its cynical opinion of the media seemed hypocritical , since this film is just as exploitive and violent as the tabloid tv show it was railing against for the whole two hours of this film .",DSc
"for those who think that what movies need today are more elaborate gimmicks , time code is the answer , since it is nothing but one long , insufferable gimmick . collectively these 4 movies form one story with the characters moving freely between the sections of the screen . the most exciting parts are when the characters place cell phone calls across quadrants for a little chitchat . the result is the artistic type of experiment that seems designed to put film critics in ecstasy over the movie's showy , avant-garde techniques . the film would seem destined to be played and discussed ad nauseam at college film courses . it should be pointed out that one can achieve almost the same effect any afternoon at your local sears store by turning 4 adjoining television sets on 4 different soap operas . yes , this approach will not permit the interaction between frames , but soap operas are so alike that you can easily imagine that the characters in the various shows are conversing . most viewers , however , will be more likely to point out time code's two fatal flaws . first , none of the stories in time code are worth including in a normal movie . most of the stories will have viewers alternating between wondering what they are about and not caring what the answer is . second , although having multiple screens is undeniably cute , it is just a distraction . sony's new marketing campaign suggests that viewers see the movie four times , watching a different quadrant at each session . since it's only the interaction between the quadrants that make the story the least bit compelling , concentrating on one would be painful . the large , stellar cast improvise their parts based on a written outline . figgis raises the audio level in the quadrant on which he would like us to focus , but even when he tries to get our eyes elsewhere , it's hard to look away as these two actresses in the back of a limo play kissy-face like a pair of love-struck teens . the only completely satisfying part of the production is the music , especially a long , dreamy section of a gustav mahler symphony . closing your eyes enhances the pleasure , but you run the risk of falling asleep . this is also a problem with your eyes open . i would rather have seen that movie than time code . it is rated r for drug use , sexuality , language and a scene of violence and would be acceptable for older teens .",SRh

"what do you get if you use tim burton , the inspired and irreverent director of batman and ed wood , to combine an invasion force of bug- eyed , big-brained martians , a star-studded cast featuring some of the biggest names in hollywood , and a huge special effects budget ? sadly , one of 1996's most disappointing motion pictures . mars attacks ! , burton's half-satire/half-homage to '50s b-movies , is a stillborn affair that could have been -- and should have been -- a whole lot hipper and funnier . if you've seen the two-minute theatrical trailer , you've seen nearly everything that's worthwhile in the feature . with such a mammoth cast , it's not surprising that only a few actors get more than token attention . even glenn close , who is billed second , has a total of ten minutes of screen time and only a handful of lines ( memorizing dialogue must have been exceptionally undemanding ) . there's absolutely nothing in any of these characters for an audience to latch on to . there are a few nicely-executed comic performances . natalie portman gives us a bored first daughter who has perhaps the best line ( taken in context ) in the entire movie ( "" i guess it wasn't the bird "" ) . rod steiger effectively emulates george c . scott's war-mongering general turgidson from dr . strangelove . pierce brosnan and sarah jessica parker make for a fun-but-brainless ( or maybe that should be "" body-less "" ) pair . and jim brown does a fine job playing off of his blaxploitation image by punching out aliens left and right . contains a number of genuinely funny moments that occur both through the dialogue and as a result of the visual approach ( there's a godzilla cameo , the "" bowling over "" of stonehenge , and a sequence where the martians toy with the washington monument before toppling it ) . unfortunately , too many attempts at comedy don't succeed , creating long stretches between laughs . another problem is that , on more than one occasion , when burton finds a gag that works , he overuses it . strangelove-type satire , the focus is on less-vicious , more obvious forms of mocking . in addition to its other faults , mars attacks ! is not well-edited . in fact , there are portions that border on incoherent . the movie lurches disjointedly from scene-to-scene as the tone careens from turgid to fast-paced . plot doesn't really matter , which is a good thing . many of the special effects ( especially those involving flying saucers and mass destruction ) have an intentionally cheesy edge , and danny elfman's score contains throwback elements . the overall problem is that the idea of mars attacks ! works a lot better on paper than in practice . although the two films were developed separately and during the same time frame , the temptation exists to say that this film is satirizing the earlier blockbuster . while that's not the case , mars attacks ! does lampoon the genre that spawned id4 . i was anticipating a lot from mars attacks ! , but what i got was a shell of my expectations . there are too many characters , too little story , and too much unfunny and repetitious material . the first half is painfully slow , forcing us to suffer through the needlessly laborious exercise of meeting and learning something about each of the characters . despite burton's effort and ingenuity , there's never an effective comic or sci-fi payoff . gives us tantalizing glimpses of brilliance , but those moments only illustrate how flawed and unsatisfactory the rest of the film is .",JBe
"so far , the lineup goes three deep . grisham's novels all have a depressing sameness to them , and this one is no different . we have the young , good looking hero crusading for right . whether he wins or not isn't important , only that he gives it his best shot and , in doing so , redeems himself . this isn't just the plot of the chamber , it's the plot of the firm and a time to kill . and , if you do a little gender-swapping , it's also the plot of the pelican brief . frankly , when you get down to it , the client isn't all that different , either . these are the "" grisham men "" -- the good-looking , young actors who play basically the same hero . so why does a young hotshot like adam take such a hopeless case ? as i indicated earlier , the chamber isn't so much about getting sam off as it is about adam exorcising his personal ghosts . this isn't a deep or intelligent examination of either -- it's a blatant attempt to push viewers' buttons , relying on speeches and melodrama to replace an honest , more powerful form of emoting . too often , dialogue in this film is people talking at one another , rather than to one another . there's an inherent danger in the way the chamber addresses its serious subject matter -- one that was apparent , but less blatant , in the most recent grisham adaptation , a time to kill . it's all part of the grisham formula : present facile , "" tabloid "" examinations of controversial issues . the danger arrives if members of the audience start mistaking grisham's simplistic views as thoughtful presentations rather than devices to move the plot along and get us to sympathize with the protagonist . plot-wise , the chamber is full of seeming irrelevancies . the movie should have been streamlined better ; there's no need to try to include virtually every character from the book . some of them , like lela rochon's nora stark , could have been cut out with little loss . grisham likes defining characters as "" good "" or "" evil "" , which is why playing the racism card is such a cop-out : by definition , racists are bad -- and most of them presented here are downright monstrous . the exception is cayhall , who we learn may not be guilty at all . grisham allows sam to be painted with shades of gray , and , not surprisingly , he becomes the most interesting character in the film . of course , that could also have something to do with the passionate portrayal given by gene hackman , who comes across as the cream of the crop even in a john grisham movie . chris o'donnell , on the other hand , is flat , and his character is dull . we're supposed to be identifying with this guy , but he fails to grab our attention , let alone our imagination . when it comes to the actual death row scenes , the chamber is especially weak . even last dance was more impressive . there's no emotional power here , and , most importantly , no catharsis . the end of dead man walking put everyone in the audience through an emotional and ethical ringer , and there weren't many dry eyes in the house . the chamber , on the other hand , is mechanical and artificial , and tells you what to think . if anyone was crying at my showing , they hid it well . ultimately , of course , that's the problem with grisham -- he presents shallow , modern-day pulp fiction , so , when he pretends to deal with serious issues , it's all a thinly-disguised masquerade . -- ingmar bergman",JBe

"albert brooks has always been a filmmaker who couldn't resist a great high concept . an inspired , outrageous situation has provided brooks with the spark to show his characters -- notably himself -- coming to terms with themselves and finding a little dignity . his concepts fueled the gags , but he never forgot to tell a story . the muse seems to have been born as yet another hollywood satire , poking fun at the insecurities of movie folk and ther fascination with the latest insta-cure for what ails them personally or professionally . the insider gags , unfortunately , are about the only ones that work . more often , the muse is a comedy in search of something , _anything_ funny to say . sharon stone's finicky diva is an idea that never quite takes off , and the supporting players often look vaguely bored with their lines . even brooks' usually reliable persona can't jump-start the film , because it doesn't turn into a sympathetic character . he's just an annoyed privileged guy whose annoyance at his slightly lessened privilege makes him just plain annoying . brooks' lack of a character is part of the over-riding problem with the muse : a lack of anything substantial past the thin premise . the film occasionally looks like it could be leading stephen towards a little growing up , whether about his career neuroses or his retro-breadwinner agitation at laura's growing financial success as a cookie-maker . there's even the faint hope that brooks could be offering a light-hearted look at the shove people require just to believe in their own talents . then the film ends , and it becomes evident that there's not a shred of actual story to the muse . there's no improved mutual understanding in the phillips' relationship , no one grows , no one learns a thing -- there's not even the satisfaction of sarah explaining her own turns of character . the whole thing just fades to black , leaving a shallow collection of industry jokes in its wake . there are a few decent laughs to be found in brooks' validation of william goldman's line about how "" nobody knows anything "" in hollywood . mark feuerstein has a nicely understated role as a tactless studio executive , and steven wright appears briefly as the nepotistically- advantaged stan spielberg . but much of the acidic humor leaves a sour aftertaste once it's clear that it's all little more than a chance for brooks to vent . his character spends much of the film in search of a third act for his screenplay , which is ironic when you consider that the muse is in desperate need of a third act of its own . it's even more ironic that in the middle of a hollywood satire , the protagonist's brilliant script -- the one he's inspired to write after being told he has "" lost [his] edge "" -- is a wacky high-concept vehicle for jim carrey . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .",SRe
"most romantic comedies make it known early in the proceedings that they intend to follow all the time-honored , tried-and-true conventions of the genre by leading us down a well-trodden path littered with formulaic plots and overused character types . for the most part , 'til there was you , 1997's april romance movie , manages to avoid this trap , and , in the process , has the dubious distinction of making us wonder if by-the-numbers familiarity is necessarily a bad thing . in trying to be different by using the sleepless in seattle approach of keeping the main characters apart until the finale , 'til there was you feels like a joke without a punchline . the payoff , such as it is , is distressingly anticlimactic , and results in frustration . nevertheless , because the actors are charismatic and their characters are likable , the picture never loses its way . we look forward to the inevitable moment when the two will meet , but the script doesn't seem to be dragging its feet getting to that point . that's not the case with 'til there was you . although many of the details are different from those in sleepless , the approach and intent are the same . sadly , the rhythm is all wrong . part of the problem with 'til there was you is that the characters aren't all that compelling . and let's face it : mcdermott and tripplehorn aren't hanks and ryan . they don't light up the screen in such a way that their mere presence can save an otherwise-stillborn scene . and 'til there was you has many stagnant moments . at one- hundred twelve minutes , it runs too long and becomes unnecessarily involved in poorly-developed , uninteresting subplots ( like the one to save an "" historically important "" housing complex ) . the movie fails to divert us along the long and twisting road to their rendezvous . after that , the film hurries to the "" happily ever after "" conclusion without giving us the opportunity to care whether the relationship works . first time feature director scott winant and screenwriter winnie holzman have apparently forgotten why people go to romantic comedies . as disappointing as much of 'til there was you is , there are some high points . certain individual scenes -- gwen's revealing heart-to- heart with her father ( michael tucker ) , gwen and francesca's lively bathroom chat , and nick's final attempt to be truly honest with francesca -- work extremely well . i also appreciated the manner in which coincidence is woven throughout the script without the characters ever making mention of it ( for example , it's up to us to figure out that nick's father's uncle was gwen's grandmother's long lost love ) . unfortunately , the good parts of 'til there was you are oases in a desert . they can't save the whole thing , which , in the end , seems like nothing more ambitious than a sleepless in seattle wannabe . by definition , romantic comedies are supposed to be "" feel good "" experiences , but , rather than leaving its audience enchanted , 'til there was you trails dissatisfaction in its wake .",JBe
"worse still , the only thing about live and let die to weather the test of time is its title song ( written by paul & linda mccartney , and performed by wings ) . without kgb agents and the threat of worldwide destruction , this 007 adventure seems lame and misplaced . live and let die sees roger moore groping for the right tone for his bond -- half the time , he appears to be attempting to imitate connery ( although this could be the fault of the screenplay ) . at least moore has a modicum of screen presence , which is more than can be said of two other bonds : lazenby and dalton . of all the bond adventures , this is the most dated . one look at the film and it's obvious it was filmed in the '70s . george martin's score only adds to the "" leisure suit flavor "" , proving that the definitive bond composer is john barry .

"instead , it's a black comedy/satire that ruthlessly skewers political extremism by suggesting that the farther to the left or right you travel on the political spectrum , the closer you move to the same destination . call it "" circular politics "" . according to dan rosen's script , it's possible for the most die-hard liberals to be as reactionary as their conservative counterparts . while there's nothing new about this philosophy , the last supper approaches it from a fresh , decidedly unconventional perspective . for the first thirty minutes , this picture takes a solid premise and runs with it . unfortunately , the momentum eventually flags , and the last supper meanders through an unnecessarily-protracted middle segment . things don't snap back into focus until the final scenes . first time feature director stacy title ( who helmed the 1993 , oscar-nominated short , "" down on the waterfront "" ) doesn't play favorites in the lampooning game -- liberals , conservatives , and moderates all get theirs . the last supper also consciously attacks political correctness by depicting the somewhat-absurd lengths to which this predominant social philosophy can be taken . the underlying message is that we should be more concerned with people and individual freedoms than with a specific ideology . zack doesn't appreciate their ideals . but that's not the end of it . they realize that perhaps they have done humanity a favor by ridding it of such a misfit . one of the major problems with the last supper is that , following an auspicious setup , it stagnates . although this eventually dovetails with the main story , the connection is too tenuous to be worth all the screen time spent on it . occasionally , the last supper tries to be serious , but drama is by far the film's weakest element . there are also attempt to develop character arcs for some of the one-dimensional protagonists , but these don't work , either . often-bizarre personality changes happen too abruptly to be credible . none of the primary actors does an especially good job . too often in motion pictures , the ideas are much better than the execution . that's the case here . but the last supper doesn't push the envelope far enough . the edge could be better honed . and , in the end , that makes pickings a little slim at this particular meal .",JBe
"and , as the election draws closer , horrigan's chances of averting a second tragedy seem progressively less likely . john malkovich may be one of the big screen's most overlooked actors . or , at least he was until this performance . it isn't that he's never done good work before--his version of lenny in gary sinese's of mice and men was one reason for that film's place in my top ten for last year--but most of the time he hasn't been recognized for it . however , like anthony hopkins in silence of the lambs , now that malkovich has been given a highly visible role in a significant movie , people will hopefully begin to rave about him . the job he does in in the line of fire is certainly worthy of praise . hands down , malkovich's assassin is the best thing about this excellent thriller--a villain that rivals hannibal lecter for intelligence and cold , calculated viciousness . rene russo gives her strongest performance to date . she has quite a bit of screen exposure , but not much meat to sink her teeth into . but , even playing second fiddle to malkovich and one of hollywood's most popular leading men , she gets noticed . eastwood is eastwood , albeit a more vulnerable version akin to what we saw in unforgiven . horrigan gives us the human side of eastwood--the side that we never get in a dirty harry film , the side that isn't afraid to shed a tear . director wolfgang petersen , best known for das boot , but also at the helm for the taut , twisted shattered , is aware of what's necessary to make a good thriller work . he knows the importance of pacing , and plays the tension in in the line of fire like a virtuoso . petersen takes what could have been a muddled motion picture and structures it perfectly , creating a superlative piece of entertainment . it helps , of course , that he has a strong cast . plot-wise , in the line of fire is nothing extraordinary . it's basically a formula-type thriller with one or two twists thrown in to keep the view off-balance . however , strength of character , coupled with a consistently high level of excitement , makes this film anything but ordinary . the most intriguing element of in the line of fire is the cat-and-mouse game between horrigan and leary . the relationship of these two characters to each other is fascinating , as it explores psychological layers which many motion pictures find too difficult to convey realistically . while there are similarities in the underlying plot structures of the two movies , development and execution are radically different . in the line of fire is an intelligent motion picture ; the bodyguard represents mindless entertainment . it's interesting how some of the most simple special effects can be the most effective . video manipulation shows a few clips that appear to have horrigan right in the midst of jfk's dallas entourage . the editing is done exceptionally well ; it isn't easy to tell that eastwood wasn't behind the president and first lady . if nothing else , these scenes justify one of the themes of michael crichton's novel rising sun--that video images can no longer be trusted to represent the truth . first , while the music by ennio morricone is effective at times , there is at least one incident--during a rooftop chase--when it sounds like a regurgitation of something from the untouchables . i know that many composers ( including morricone ) have certain "" signature "" tunes , but this reuse of something he's done in the past is a little too blatant for my liking . secondly , eastwood's horrigan has one-too-many leaps of intuition during the climactic scenes . the overt nature of this plot device is neatly camouflaged by the ever-growing tension of the sequence , but it becomes apparent upon reflection . there's nothing earlier in the film that would lead us to believe that he possesses such powers of deduction . overall , however , this is a fine film , and certainly one of the most intelligent thrillers of the summer . in the line of fire doesn't require the special effects bonanza of jurassic park to involve the audience , nor does it rely on the mega-budget explosions and mountaintop battles of cliffhanger . compared to the firm , a movie that some have identified as a picture of similar appeal and temperament , in the line of fire is far better paced and scripted . so , for a couple of hours of entertainment , in the line of fire is one of those rare "" big "" movies that doesn't disappoint .",JBe

"let's be honest . there are some movies that don't need to be made . with movies able to show almost any sexual behavior known , is there any longer any reason for one of those pseudo-instructional films on sex ? in the 1960s that was a popular way to get sex and nudity past the censors , but today our movies are quite explicit , too explicit some will undoubtedly argue . in one of the most pedantic shows in some time , characters read from the instructions on sex and love with complete seriousness and devotion , but it is dry as reading the phone book . okay , maybe as lively as the dictionary . looking something like an aerobics class , the teachers in kama sutra read to groups of women students the precise way to caress the toes . ( there is precious little actual sex or nudity in the movie although there is some . just like in the old risque pictures , more is promised than delivered . the script titillates while insulting the audience's intelligence . ) because the last indian film i saw , jaya ganga , was such an unexpected delight , i naively went to kama sutra with positive expectations . within 15 minutes of arrival , however , i was already checking my watch . kama sutra's rich sets by mark friedberg , gorgeous cinematography by declan quinn , and elegant red and gold costumes by eduardo castro are the only reasons to see the picture . but , as people rarely buy playboy to read the articles , the only possible reason people would stay to see all of kama sutra is to wait for another brief glimpse of flesh .

"cast : jean-paul belmondo , michel boujenah , alessandra martines , salome lelouch director : claude lelouch producer : claude lelouch screenplay : claude lelouch , inspired by the novel by victor hugo cinematography : clause lelouch music : francis lai , philippe servain , erik berchot , michel legrand , and didier barbelivien u . s . distributor : warner brothers in french with english subtitles claude lelouch's les miserables is one of the year's motion picture triumphs : an epic drama that takes the themes of victor hugo's novel and transplants them to the twentieth century . rather than merely re- telling a story that has previously been brought to life in a variety of different incarnations ( including a hugely popular musical ) , lelouch has chosen to take ideas , plot strings , and themes from the novel and apply them in a unique and tremendously effective manner to the greatest tragedy of this century : world war ii and hitler's final solution . as the story-within-the-story unfolds--complete with filmed scenes lifted directly from the novel--henri is enraptured , seeing parallels in his own life to both les miserables' jean valjean and cosette . those familiar with les miserables will immediately recognize the boundless symbols and references--some subtle , some obvious . those who have never read the book , seen a previous filmed version , or experienced the musical will not be left floundering , however . lelouch re-tells enough of the original that a person would have to be blind not to see the interconnections . it's difficult to emphasize what lelouch has accomplished with this movie . no film that i'm familiar with has so ably intersected a classical novel with a modern tale . it's been tried , most frequently with shakespeare , but never has the result been such an unqualified success . this version of les miserables is a masterpiece precisely because it doesn't merely regurgitate hugo's tale . it's something simultaneously new and timeless . above all , les miserables is a story of the indomitable nature of the human spirit . despite the title and its attendant images of misery , poverty , injustice , and oppression ( all of which are present in one form or another ) , the movie is a decidedly uplifting experience , because its concentration is on the power to overcome . to be sure , there's much evil in this world , but there's good as well . lelouch re-uses actors to underscore the parallels between hugo's book and his own story . numerous other actors do similar multi-character duty . then , there are times when clips from a previous , black-and- white version of les miserables are artfully intersected with lelouch's all-color images . although belmondo's performance is towering , his co-stars are exceptional enough not to be reduced to scenery . michel boujenah and alessandra martines are more than capable of holding up their corners of the story , but the real find is young salome lelouch , an impressive young actress who deserves more exposure in future features . as in nikita mikhalkov's burnt by the sun ( where the director's granddaughter had a key role ) , this is a rare instance when nepotism uncovers an acting gem . themes echo and resonate through every minute of the nearly-three hour picture . the director is constantly reminding us that what makes a story great , whatever the medium chosen for its telling , is that in it we see ourselves and people we know . nowhere is this more true than in les miserables . whether hugo's , lelouch's , or both , you will rarely find a more powerful , cathartic , and ultimately satisfying narrative to immerse yourself in .",JBe
"as you might surmise from a mainstream film like this , it wants to pull you along with all the heartaches it can muster from these lonely souls , and it does so , by making use of semi flashbacks and scenes that have a mixture of fantasy and reality to it . to a lesser degree , this style of filmmaking also works for the less complicated pat , as his mental grief comes pouring out in spurts . the film's title , living out loud , is deliberately misleading , as it should really be retitled as "" fantasizing out loud . "" this therefore becomes a film more intrigued with self-awareness than with relationships and loses its edge as a romantic film . its brightest hope is how the viewer relates to the film's stars . i didn't , so the film just seemed to drag for me at times and it seemed manipulative , to the bargain . my problem is that i didn't really care what happened to them . why they were sad and lonely , is a sympathetic enough story , but there was just nothing served up that made me feel that this predictable story had anywhere important to go . the only innovative feature of the film , which did save it from the doldrums , was that we were able to go inside their heads and hear their thinking process at work . the filmmaker has borrowed this guise of introspection from the pages of chekhov , which works out reasonably well on film , though it is still better served as a device for the reader of books . at least the film never turns to mush , as its static atmosphere is enhanced mostly by some of the lively nightclub scenes , such as when liz is belting out her sultry jazz numbers and offering good cheer for advice ( trust me , it wasn't on a par to the biblical solomon's advice ) . but i couldn't picture them falling in love for even a second and certainly not for a minute , these two were just not compatable . but come to think of it , she's pretty dull herself . the fantasy she has of making it with the hunk masseur ( cibrian ) , who gives her the sex massage she dreams of , are the kind of private thoughts that perhaps more people have than what is commonly thought , but this is certainly not a way to self-discovery and a way out of her situation , though it seems to help her in someway , but the film has really not made it clear how she was helped . this bittersweet romance turns out to be too dry for my taste ; but , it is , nevertheless , faultlessly told and seems to be sincere in its presentation , and what the heck , they seem to be ok people , and probably merit a tad of sympathy for their plight . his attempt here to make a combination fantasy and a straight romance film , has worked with mixed results . i think the major fault for the film's dullness lies with the co-stars ; i couldn't get aroused by holly hunter's performance , as intelligent as it was , it was still too plain and too staid . while danny de vito , who is a natural comic and is best at being featured as a second-banana , wasn't funny enough here and couldn't be taken seriously enough as a romantic suitor for holly . i'm not saying that he was completely miscast , he did bring some depth to his character's anguished situation and believability to his role . but someone else , a more romantic leading man , might have given the film a romantic tension to it that it desperately needed . though i realize the point of the story was that these two weren't really suited for each other in the first place and that this was the odd twist to their non-romance . but my point is , that they could have been not suited for each other all right , but not by such a wide margin as these two were . but that was also too predictable an ending , limiting the scope of the film .",DSc

"rather than attempting to recreate the hayley mills role from the 1961 classic , she brings her own vivacious freshness to make it a completely different movie , albeit with the same plot . whether you like the original movie or not , you will love the delightful remake . part comedy and part romance , the movie can even bring the audience to tears with its considerations of the bonds that exist between parent and child . the film's lovely script is by nancy meyers and charles shyer , the writing team for the wonderful father of the bride movies . they have a talent for blending in just enough silly comedy to win the hearts of the youngest members of the audience , while still keeping the story intelligent and the characters richly drawn . meyers , who tries her hand at directing for the first time in this film , has a good sense of timing and a knack for staging that ranges from the sweet to the slapstick without ever going overboard . both families are rich enough to have their own butlers , although americans would never call them such , of course , since it would imply some sort of class system . both have more than enough personality to be the stars of their own movies . they are more like part of the family than hired help , and they significantly add to rather than merely complement the storyline . the setup for the plot is that the girls do not know they are twins and have never seen their other parent . these scenes will send the younger members of the audience rolling in giggles , but they are done with enough class to amuse the adults as well . the girls have such genuine chemistry for each other that the audience is rooting for them to pull off their big scheme . from this point on , the story has the good judgement to focus more on the relationship than the gimmicks of the impersonations . perhaps the most amazing part of the parent trap is its universal appeal . it will delight all sexes and ages , even adults with no children . few films can pull this off , but the parent trap does with almost complete success . it is rated pg for reasons that are not immediately obvious , and the movie should appeal to all ages . my son jeffrey and his buddy nickolas , both 9 , loved the movie and each gave it  .",SRh
"the joy luck club , as stated in the movie's opening narrative , is a collection of four aging chinese women bound together more by hope than by joy or luck . since i didn't count , i can't verify this statement , but it sounds about right . taken as a whole , all of these vignettes combine to lend greater meaning to the whole . the joy luck club is the sum total of its parts with common themes giving solid grounding and greater resonance to the overall film . as bass comments , "" i saw all the mothers' and daughters' stories as facets of the same experience . that's the genius of the book , and if we cut it down to just a couple of stories it would be like any other movie .

"" if this is true , then the joy luck club fits into the latter category . certainly , a tear-jerker like this is likely to find more open acceptance among women than among men . that's not necessarily because men won't like it , but some will be too embarrassed to admit that they enjoyed something as emotional as this . in fact , there are those who may refuse to see it to avoid this possible dilemma altogether . nevertheless , there will be a group of people who will genuinely dislike the joy luck club , and i can't say that their reasoning is entirely flawed . the movie has a few moments that can justifiably be described as cloying and manipulative , and those who are offended by these methods are going to become annoyed at the joy luck club . die-hard cynics are advised to stay clear . what the aforementioned people have missed , however , is that the scenes that don't work are far fewer in number than those that do , and most of these can easily be overlooked in piecing together the overall intent of the motion picture . few movies are without at least a problem or two , and it's more difficult to put together a flawless production when going for the emotional payoffs that this film does . the joy luck club is clearly--perhaps too clearly--an adaptation of a book . the dialogue is often too poetic to be real , and the story too clearly plotted to be acceptable as anything more than an imperfect reflection of the world we live in . i hasten to add that this is not a bad thing , but it is evidence that this movie , through its willingness to loosen the strings of realism , expects a certain suspension of disbelief from the audience . personally , i never identified with any of the characters , but i became involved in their stories . that is to say , never did i make a connection between something in my own life and what i was seeing on screen , but that in no way diminished the impact of what was being presented . i venture to say that many women , especially those who have had tempestuous relationships with their mothers or daughters , will have an entirely different viewpoint . the line between drama and melodrama is a fine one , and most of the joy luck club successfully navigates the tightrope , staying on the more powerful dramatic side . there are times when it slips and comes across as heavy-handed . you know something isn't right when it becomes apparent that certain lines of dialogue and character actions are trying desperately to make you , as a member of the audience , shed a tear . whether or not these incidents do what they're trying to is another matter entirely . . . . wayne wang , whose best-known previous film was dim sum , shows significant ability in the way he has structured this movie . many are played by more than one actor ( as children then adults , for example ) , but all changes are smooth and seamless . it's as easy to accept a little girl as waverly as it is the beautiful , sophisticated-looking tamlyn tomita , and that's because the characters transcend the performers portraying them . it's fascinating and satisfying the way that the diverse threads are knitted together into a single tapestry . some might complain that this movie is a downer , but those who do , fail to recognize that the joy luck club's message is one of hope , and that catharsis and emotional fulfillment often come through tragedy . sure , a lot of bad things happen during the course of this film , but at the end , the tears are of happiness and new beginnings , not loss .",JBe

"it is richly adapted from a jeffrey eugenides novel by director sofia coppola . the film is an evocative visual depiction of a typical suburban family and community . it dwells on the sadness found under all the attractive girls's smiling faces , leaving one with a lingering feeling of helplessness about their situation . adolescence is scrutinized by sofia coppola in a cinematically crafted manner , finely inspired by what we think we remember about that age when looking back at it , with the implication that the girls at that time knew more about the boys than the other way around . the boys , except for one , are insecure and clumsy around the girls . edward lachman's photography has a mesmerizing look to it , as he seems to have his camera covered with a filter to make the shots appear fuzzy , which complements a story that can't be completely put together because we don't know the answers as to why the girls' did what they did . despite liking much about the film and respecting the eclectic approach the director used , i still found that this film wasn't talking to me . i felt i was asked to be a mourner at a once in a lifetime story that has the possibility to pop up some day on the tv news as one of those bizarre events that just happen without cause , but the story itself went no deeper than how the tv news would cover it . the exploration of the teens in their growing pains , their ordinary wants , and even in their grandeur , left me scratching my head at this allegorical tale , wondering how it was that the sunshine couldn't get inside them , why they were symbolically cut down in life like the diseased elm tree in front of their house was , where i could at least see the disease in the tree's yellow leaves . i don't know how much of their futility i could see , as the more i thought about them , the more they seemed like ghosts than real people , and they all started looking like each other , so i couldn't distinguish one from the other , except for lux , who for some reason in all her boldness and sexuality , couldn't find the strength to live . which left me perplexed as to why the film thrived on not telling a complete story . if i tried to know more about the girls , i would only become like the shrink , giving off pat answers to something that was supposed to remain a mystery . i don't know if this is a good or a bad way for a film to leave the viewer , but i do know i felt something profound was missing here , as the film was more revealing about the boys and their idealization of the girls than it was about the girls and what they were really like . this seemed misplaced storytelling , since the girls' story should have been more compelling than the boys' awkward adolescent tale was . what saves this film , is the innovative way the director filmed the story , covering up the fluff to make the story look deeper than it was .",DSc

"" they're certain to put a smile on your face . it is rated r for "" language and some sexuality "" and would be acceptable for teenagers . just send me a letter with the word "" subscribe "" in the subject line .",SRh
"the persian gulf war of 1991 is put to celluloid and made into this action-packed adventure story and intelligent political satire of the once seemingly popular war , that would supposedly regain the american sense of "" feeling good "" about itself that needed resurrection after the vietnam debacle . this was a war that made americans proud of the technology developed such as , smart bombs , and of how casualty free and quickly the war was won , as it was watched on tv . he has made an unconventional but traditional anti-war hollywood movie , in the likes of films such as , catch-22 and m * a * s * h . this one has a potent bite to it , just like the others , but maybe because it is filmed so soon after the bubble for american success has busted , that it seems to have such a deliciously absurd bite to it . it makes one wonder who the americans really have helped with this war aside from some rich kuwaitis . what the film clearly shows , is that the bulk of the iraqi people , not the inner circle of the dictator , seem to be bearing the brunt of the war's dire consequences . the premise of the film is excellent ; the story succeeds as both an entertaining action film and as a searingly funny black comedy , it is even effective as a valuable history lesson . the actors are brilliantly cast and make up for the lack of depth of their characters by giving engaging performances : george clooney is both heroic and devilish , presenting a commanding stature for his authoritative role . jonze is a real hoot and comes across as the kind of dim soldier whom it is easy to feel sorry for and not get too upset with him over his obvious mental defects . ice cube is solid . what results is a brave film , one that has a surreal and trippy feel to it , with some mortifying comedy dished out and some serious questions being raised about a war that can't come to a proper conclusion anytime too soon , as russell explores a recent part of american history that surprisingly hasn't been touched upon by other films , as of yet . the war is covered with more personal detail than i got from watching it on cnn . i feel that the filmmaker has caught the mood of most of the soldiers , who don't understand the politics of the war and just want to go home in one piece , of the career brass who are in it for promotions , the media reporters who want to not only get the story but be the first one to get it , and the politicians who can find a rational for whatever they do . the film ultimately shows that anything is possible in the amoral climate of a dictatorship and a consumer country out to protect its own interest . the reward for the audience , is seeing an exciting film , with beautiful cinematography , in addition to seeing a film that has a grave purpose to it and is funny in a serious way .",DSc
"screenplay : david koepp , based on the novel by michael crichton . director : steven spielberg . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( profanity , violence ) running time : 127 minutes . sure , the lizards in question were not entirely mechanical , but i got the point . it also turns out to be , more or less , more of the same . the lost world offers all the shallow characterization and pointless plotting of jurassic park without the sense of discovery . only in the hands of steven spielberg could that recipe add up to something moderately diverting instead of a compete disaster . in many ways , the lost world is actually an improvement over jurassic park , if for no other reason than that it is more honest . spielberg takes exactly two minutes to show us the first dinosaur in the lost world , clearly aware that there's no point in creating build-up any longer . he also takes a note from a clever line in david koepp's script given to malcolm : "" yeah , ooh ahh . . . that's always how it starts . jurassic park was almost obliged to provide the wide-eyed wonder of the completely new ; the lost world , appropriately , delivers a much higher ratio of "" running and screaming "" to "" ooh ahh . "" it also doesn't have laura dern as a dumber-than-triceratops-dung paleobotanist , giggling like a schoolgirl over malcolm's description of chaos theory , or ariana richards shrieking about unix systems . what the lost world _does_ have is a generous helping of scenes and characters which are awfully familiar . pete postlethwaite plays this year's version of the great white hunter while arliss howard plays this year's version of the corporate scum ; the gallimimus stampede of jp becomes lost world's parasauralophus stampede . even the sequence of attacks feels derivative : t . rex attacks a vehicle and tries to push it over a cliff , t . rex chases people , people trek toward a distant goal , velociraptors take their turn . jurassic park was more enjoyable than it should have been because we had never seen this stuff before . lost world is the same stuff , just in greater quantities . those greater quantities are probably going to satisfy movie-goers who like their action fast and furious , with minimal interruption for silly little things like character development . no one will argue that that the lost world is much more than a string of set pieces ; there is also little question that a few of those set pieces are directed with that indescribable spielberg something . when spielberg is "" on , "" the results can be dizzying , and he's "" on "" just often enough to give the lost world a few satisfying sparks . like us , he's been there and done that . i believe i have seen jurassic park four times since its initial release , and i have enjoyed it less each time . if i had seen the lost world for the first time in 1993 -- if the order of the two films had been reversed -- i suspect i would have found it positively thrilling . in 1997 , it's just like watching jurassic park for the fifth time , when it's hard to get worked up over a film which has little going for it besides big mechanical lizards .",SRe
"so what is the cube root of 1729 . 03 , and what algorithmic short cuts can you employee to arrive at the answer ? do you think you could get the answer quicker than a high speed abacus driver ? these are some of the conundrums that form the side show of infinity . broderick knows exactly what he wants to do as a director and does it . he lovingly crafts an extremely slow moving film . his acting in the title role is dispassionate and unhurried with his emotions carefully kept in check . he is in no hurry to do anything nor get excited about any event . i have an image of broderick in the director's chair coaching his cast to slow down and take each scene with carefully measured paces . the entire show moves with strange rhythm that you will either find so languid you fall asleep or will cast a spell over you and draw you into the quiet world of a scientist's love affair . for some inexplicable reason , i found myself in the latter category , but if you see the film and find it feels like infinity watching it , i will understand . and yet , i found the film soothing as a warm bath and tranquil as a gentle breeze . as a daddy , i have found that fatherly advice sometimes seems to make little sense even when i am the one giving it so this scene hit home . i'll spare you the medical science behind what might or might not have been the problem . i talk to copernicus everyday .

"when you think of al pacino , the image that comes to mind is one of energy , intensity , and violence . so it's more than a minor departure for the actor to appear in james foley's two bits as gitano sabatoni , a dying , regretful old man . this is a small , understated role--character actor material--yet pacino immerses himself so fully in the part that we forget about the performer the moment we see the performance . despite pacino's presence in the cast , this isn't his movie . nor does it belong to mary elizabeth mastrantonio , who has a supporting role as gitano's timid daughter . it's a day of eye-opening experiences and tough lessons ; of awareness , magic , and sadness . until 6 pm , there's a special rate at the cinema : get in for only 25 cents . the story is simple , and the film's message is equally as plain : never give up wanting and striving , no matter how unattainable the dream seems . for gennaro in two bits , that goal is watching a movie in the air-conditioned confines of la paloma . as the film progresses , this simple theater takes on a monumental symbolic importance . although two bits isn't explicitly about the love of movies , a sense of affection and admiration for the black-and-white classics of the time permeates the production , beginning with the clips shown during the opening credits . the film is suffused with nostalgia--at times it's almost excessive--and the period set design is effective . it's apparent from the tone that this is a filmed memoir , not a fictional account . the greatest failing of two bits is a tendency to ramble . individual episodes work well on their own , but some of the connecting material is weak , and the voiceover is often more irritating than helpful . the film is also too self-conscious about getting across its theme . subtlety would have worked fine , but , to make sure we don't miss it , al pacino's character states the message explicitly . two bits represents an undemanding form of entertainment--a period piece that lives on nostalgia and an elemental story . perhaps the most successful aspect of this film is that it encourages us to connect events in gennaro's life with moments in our own , thereby enriching the emotional impact . credit director foley ( glengarry glen ross ) for another fine , character-based piece .",JBe
"date released : 5/28/93 running length : 1 : 50 rated : pg-13 ( language , mature themes , sexual situations , brief nudity ) yeah , there are a lot of implausibilities in this script , but the story moves along snappily enough that most of them are easily overlooked . more difficult to miss is richard benjamin's occasionally inadequate direction . there are numerous scenes that could have been a whole lot funnier had benjamin been more deft in choreographing them . too often , he is heavy-handed , but the film survives in spite of him . the first half of made in america is highly amusing . comedy is divided nicely between the outrageous and the subtle ( although bejamin likes to "" point out "" the less obvious moments by using tricks such as slow-motion ) . unfortunately , the comic momentum fades as the film moves to a climax , with the big "" plot twist "" near the end seeming like something out of bad television melodrama . there are a lot of different ways that the story could have gone ; the route it chooses is less-than-satisfying . surprisingly , although this is billed as a romantic comedy , i didn't find the romance between sarah and hal of particular note . despite the rumors linking goldberg and danson together off-screen , there doesn't seem to be much chemistry between them . i could believe these , which are at times touching and sweet , and on other occasions laced with bitterness . there's no question that the best performance is given by nia long . goldberg and danson don't have to stretch much to keep in character . never have i been more impressed with ms . tilly's acting than when she stares into the camera with that vacuous expression . one of the failures of made in america is in the way it introduces the two main characters . at the outset of the film , both sarah and hal are portrayed as irresponsible , arrogant , and thoroughly dislikeable . although they soften as the story progresses , and the audience gradually warms to them , this is not a positive way to start a movie . it's typical in a romantic comedy for one of the partners to be acerbic and unpleasant , but it's unusual for this to be true of both of them . had the comedy been less fresh , made in america might have lost me early on . as far as comedies go , this one is above-average , primarily because there aren't many clunkers among its jokes . character development is so-so , and there are number of problems , some of which are significant , about the way the story progresses during the last half-hour . overall , however , made in america is enjoyable . it handles the issue of a mixed-race relationship sensitively ( instead of sensationalistically ) and presents an intriguing look at a very different family dynamic .",JBe

"" director clint eastwood chooses an ideal , languid pace for midnight which turns it into the perfect southern story : in no particular hurry to get anywhere , yet still intriguing in its richness of detail . in berendt's novel , that fragmented approach turns the city of savannah itself into the story's principal character . the williams trial functions primarily as a lightning rod for the attitudes and perceptions of the city's inhabitants , in whom eccentricity is ultimately a matter of degree . there are , however , some vacuums hollywood abhors , and midnight in the garden of good and evil tries to fill two of them with some pretty ineffective stuff . hancock works wonders with the novel's decade-long time frame , condensing events with impressive economy . he also strains to shove the story's square pegs into the gaping round hole of studio picture paradigms . hancock and eastwood may very well have made the best adaptation of midnight possible within a studio system . the acting is first-rate from top to bottom ( including a sly and charismatic debut by the lady chablis as him/herself ) , eastwood's technical team delivers typical excellence , and many of the book's best situations are re-created with sharp humor . there's just something vaguely unsatisfying about midnight , and not just in comparison to its source material . this story cries out for a less conventional treatment , though it's still fairly unconventional by most standards . the makers of midnight had their heart in the right place , but the result teases with the promise of an off-beat exploration it delivers only sporadically . perhaps the answer to that screenwriting assignment is even trickier than the question . you don't . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line "" subscribe "" .",SRe

"senseless is a completely generic comedy that is only occasionally enlivened by the on-screen antics of marlon wayans . yet , while wayans has the energy and malleable features to match those of jim carrey ( whom he appears to be impersonating ) , he isn't endowed with quite as forceful a screen presence . of course , it doesn't help that he isn't given much to work with . the screenplay is dumb , and director penelope spheeris , who has ridden her wayne's world success through a series of mediocre movies , can't seem to find a stable tone . she seems to be striving for something more sophisticated than mere physical comedy , but her attempts never reach fruition . in fact , there are isolated instances when senseless almost seems grim . the screenplay does nothing with a potentially-interesting premise . for the most part , senseless falls into the category of "" underdog makes good .

"it has long been recognized that hitler's final solution exterminated more than jews . to this date , most films have examined the tragedy from the jewish point-of-view . a select few , such as steven spielberg's oscar- winning schindler's list , have presented the truth with heartbreaking , gut-wrenching clarity . rarely , however , has a motion picture attempted what bent does : show the holocaust through the eyes of two gay men enduring a grueling existence at the dachau concentration camp . unfortunately , what begins with an interesting premise and a promising first half quickly devolves into a boring , muddled , melodramatic love story . by all accounts , the live version is both startling and moving . the motion picture version is neither -- something critical was lost in the translation , even though playwright martin sherman wrote the screenplay . many of the things that can work in a play , when the live nature of the production allows an intimate rapport to develop between the actors and the audience , fail on the big screen . the final fifty minutes of bent are a prime example . the movie's first half is more successful . once the movie reaches dachau , it grinds to a screeching halt . this particular activity is not inherently cinematic in nature and bent's banal , repetitious dialogue does little to liven it up . gradually , the tediousness of the second half sucks all of the potential drama ( not to mention the energy ) out of the film . we give up caring whether the characters live or die . they don't have anything interesting to say , and the scene in which they engage in "" verbal sex "" borders on being unintentionally funny . solid performances from lead actors clive owen and lothaire bluteau go in vain . the final scene , which is supposed to be a triumphant crowd- pleaser , comes across as obvious and overplayed . one thing i don't doubt is director sean mathias' sincerity . bent is obviously an important story for him ; it's just that he and writer martin sherman made too many bad choices in adapting the play . in fact , bent's most important contribution may be to illustrate by comparison how powerful a movie like schindler's list truly is .

"the conventional wisdom is that movie sequels are never as good as the original , and the common belief among most critics is that the godfather : part ii ( 1974 ) represents the classic exception to that rule . as strong and innovative as was the godfather ( 1972 ) , most reviewers prefer its successor . ( since i recently had the opportunity to see both on the big screen again , i'll discuss in the end of this review whether i subscribe to this logic . ) unlike the linear structure of the original , part ii has two parallel stories spanning two different time periods . in an uncredited role , caan does appear briefly in a flashback sequence in part ii . ) al pacino , who was nominated for academy awards for both pictures but won neither , approaches his more mature role quite differently from the way he did in the original . this time he plays it much more soft spoken and self-assured . the beauty of the performance can be heard with the tone of his voice and seen in his lips . in most of the film he speaks as a caesar . he does not need to justify , he needs only to ask , and it shall be done . his clear but low enunciation is that of someone who has the power to make people hang on his every word . most actors confuse shouting with overacting and have trouble separating the two , but not pacino , at least not in this role .

( this church linkage , which the first two suggest but never explore , is developed into the main theme in the fairly unsuccessful part iii -- remember that sequel rule . ) both films end in a hail of violence with the editing interlacing and carefully sequencing a stream of deaths . although the first's ending was more like a goetterdammerung , both are powerful and effective . most people get lost during this part of the story , but i think that is what director francis ford coppola wanted . if you are part of the mob , it is rarely clear who are your friends and who aren't . this ambiguity is endemic to crime families . "" people behaving like that with guns . "" roth's best line is his boast to michael on the size of their crime empire -- "" we're bigger than u . s . steel !

"" every once in a while , when ravenous settles down for some good old-fashioned terror tension , you can almost enjoy it . there are a few nicely staged confrontations and creepy moments in antonia bird's direction ( or perhaps that of milcho manchevski , the director replaced two weeks into production ) , including a sequence involving a sneak attack that builds far longer than you might think possible . writer ted griffin slips a few darkly comic lines into the dialogue , and robert carlyle's manic performance helps support that tone whenever he's on screen . how much more tolerable ravenous might have been if griffin and bird had been content to let the black comedy guide them . instead , it becomes a potpourri of narrative notions and random themes : the dehumanizing destruction of battle ( i . e . , war itself as cannibalism ) , the mad drive for the american frontier ( i . e . , the manifest destiny as cultural/ecological cannibalism ) , the equally mad drive for the gold in them thar hills ( i . e . , the gold rush as economic cannibalism ) , plus yet another gloss on addiction , and on and on to a dizzying degree , with the native american myth of the weendigo thrown in for good measure . boyd's tortured quandary over whether to join this particular diners' club is played as such grand opera , infused with such socio-political baggage , that guy pearce looks like he's carrying the entire weight of western civilization on his shoulders in every scene . no one's saying that the jaunty gruesomeness of eating raoul is the only possible approach for a successful foray into same-species snacking . it may , however , be the best approach . when jeffrey jones is cracking wise while supping on a human stew , ravenous begins to emerge from its coma of self-importance ; when he pleads to be relieved of the misery of his hunger , you wonder when he suddenly developed a character of any significance . at a certain point , ravenous becomes so consumed with putting a heady spin on its subject matter that it consumes itself . a horror film with something to say between shocks is fine . it's rare -- and annoying -- to find one that just won't shut up . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .",SRe

"" there aren't many intelligent motion picture romances . and , as in that film , there's a profound sense of inevitability permeating the atmosphere , a realization that this magical time must come to an end -- and soon . it's easy to believe that francesca and robert's love is deep and special , but perhaps the real test of the film's power is whether the statements , situations , and characters transcend the screen to leave a lasting impression . not many pictures are created with the necessary skill to challenge our perceptions and beliefs , but the bridges of madison county is a rare exception .",JBe

"the vanishing is a challenging psychological thriller about a nightmare that comes true and an obsession that leads to bizarre results . it makes the most of its tale by its vivid dream sequences and the masterly holding off of its inevitable findings until its conclusion , as it relies on the viewer becoming overwhelmed with curiosity to hang on until the end . it is a superbly done suspense yarn relating to what lengths someone will go to find out something that he feels he must know about himself , as this tale is told without the usual horror film special effects . it consists of the real everydayness situations , which makes the mystery seem even scarier . the theme of disappearance has been attempted by many great directors , such as hitchcock , in his the lady vanishes , but it has never been done as spookily as it is here and from such a simple storyline . each time he goes to the designated spot of the meeting there is no one there , but he feels the presence of that person . the performances are particularly good , with gene bervoets being made into a victim , becoming a kafkaesque figure , trapped in a world that is not of his making . while johanna ter steege gives the film an inner light that captures the prevailing mood of the mystery . she is so sweet , honest , and endearing , that the continuing curiosity gene shows for what happened to her is very understandable . and , bernard-pierre donnadieu is perfectly credible as a self-absorbed psycho , someone who is devoid of passion , as his crime is not sexually motivated even if he seems to only target pretty woman ( he says that he does so because they don't expect to be victims ) . this film is so well-crafted , that it is easy to get carried away and think that more is being said here than what has transpired . but in the simplicity of its story , it becomes easy to identify with the amsterdam couple and feel caught up in their dreamworld which intermingles with their real-life . a film that is very much in the hitchcock suspense mode , as a real-chiller .",DSc

( "" say it ain't so , joe ! "" ) with so many players off to fight , however , the talent was thin . the mets had the worst initial season of any 20th century baseball team . baseball's most glaring fault is that it's too long . much too long . certain segments seem to drag interminably with little in the way of color added to the basic historical regurgitation . most of what this series has to offer can be gleaned from a good book on the sport . the analysis is rarely penetrating and the visual elements are typically stale . the moments when baseball shines are too often sandwiched around stretches of dry , straightforward documentary presentation . almost equally disappointing is the film's treatment of the modern era . burns' examination of the '70s and '80s is a spotty , hit-and-miss affair that creates few memorable impressions . baseball is at its strongest when it focuses on one of its three primary themes . the film demonstrates the elasticity of the game's appeal , and you get a sense that no matter how immediately crippling the current players' strike is , the sport will eventually overcome it . the examination of baseball's approach to segregation ( before the mid-'40s ) and integration ( thereafter ) is handled in a thought-provoking and thorough manner . burns' probing of the role of blacks in the sport--both in the negro leagues and later in the major leagues--represents one of the most insightful filmed approaches to the subject . inexplicably , however , the work stoppages of the '70s and '80s are not mentioned . fans in other parts of the country may at times feel slighted , however . and boston , other than being burns' favorite team , is hardly worthy of the amount of exposure it receives . based on relative screen time , one would have to conclude that casey stengel was a more important figure than connie mack , and yogi berra was of greater significance than steve carlton , lou brock , and mike schmidt combined . burns' civil war style of combining photographs with "" talking heads , "" period music , and voiceover quotes doesn't work as well in baseball , perhaps because the emotional resonance achieved here doesn't match that of stories of a nation torn by war . by the middle of the series , film clips are replacing still photographs , making this documentary's overall format seem more traditional than that of its predecessor . the are several noteworthy "" recreations "" of partial or entire games . in the end , a non-baseball fan who sticks with this movie for its entirety is likely to learn a lot about the sport and its history , and perhaps gain an understanding of why it inspires such passion in so many people . and every viewer , devotee or not , is herein given the opportunity to appreciate the unique synergy between the progress of the game and american history . baseball is a canvas painted with broad strokes and little detail . burns has invested an incredible amount of effort and passion into a project that is by turns insightful , nostalgic , pedantic , and ( unfortunately ) occasionally dull . "" i actually think [baseball] still is at the center of our lives in this country . oh , it has periods when it seems to be eclipsed . but baseball has so inserted itself into the american soul . its strength is uniting people , generation after generation . it's suffering from an anxiety about itself . and you know what ? knowing your own history is the best antidote to that confusion .

"a movie as a star vehicle is an honored tradition . so in 1967 when still fairly new director franco zeffirelli wanted to make his first big hollywood picture , he cast both richard burton and elizabeth taylor . the film was the taming of the shrew and with superstars like that how could he miss . the acting was sure to be good , and the press would cover every antic on the set thus building up the excitement for its release . the quality of the result is debatable , but one thing is certain , burton and taylor clearly have great fun with their acting assignments . the audience at the six weeks shakespeare festival at san jose's camera three seemed to be having a good time as well . in my judgment shakespearean comedies work best when the directors rely on the words for the humor . this is the path that kenneth branagh chose for much ado about nothing . zeffirelli opted instead for slapstick figuring that the play needed to be jazzed up with many sight gags and general physical comedy . moreover , although the words sound authentic , screenwriters suso cecchi d'amico , paul dehn , and franco zeffirelli seem to have modified a fair amount of the bard's text . i must admit that whenever i see the writing of a movie is done by a committee i take that as a bad omen . the picture is filmed by oswald morris ( academy award winner for fiddler on the roof ) and luciano trasatti in a hazy glow as if through a slightly rose tinted lens . to complement this rosy glow , the academy award nominated sets by john decuir , giuseppe mariani , lorenzo mongiardino , and elven webb look like a disney prototype for a renaissanceland . since zeffirelli viewed the play as a romp , these images help establish the spirit of the film . the story is typical for shakespeare -- full of false identities where people are not who they seem to be . taylor spends most of the first part of the film grunting and throwing things . although by the end the slapstick does subside , we have to endure flying tables of dust and other acts i found lacking in much real humor . zeffirelli also had many filthy servants with bad teeth in his attempt to provide increased mirth . sadly that was not as often as it should have been . taylor is a famous yo-yo dieter , but she was just the right size when the movie was filmed -- certainly not svelte but trim and with an overflowing bosom shown to advantage in the clothes of the period . burton too looks the part of a crude but cunning man . petruchio complains that it is , "" nothing but sit and sit , and eat and eat !

"a couple of years ago , i began reading scott smith's novel a simple plan and never made it to the halfway point . there was nothing particularly wrong with the plot -- a moody cautionary tale about the resulting spiral of guilt and violence when three men find $4 . 4 million in a wrecked plane -- nor did smith's prose style offend in any way . it seemed to me a terrible mistake , one made identification with one specific character too explicit . intriguing though the premise may have been , i couldn't get past hearing hank mitchell's voice while watching his story unfold . sam raimi's screen version of a simple plan shows how easy it can be to improve on a novel when point-of-view is its only real flaw . only there is harm done . a simple plan offers an object lesson in any number of cliched moral bon mots : crime doesn't pay , there certainly isn't any honor among thieves , and love of money is indeed the root of all evil . it's a tale of what we're made of at our core , and how little it takes to strip away the civilization in a man like hank and turn him into a savage . that probably doesn't sound like the kind of material one usually associates with raimi ( the evil dead , darkman ) , a director whose camera often seems to need a dose of ritalin . he certainly tones down his hyperkinetic visuals , but he loses none of his energy , which is why a simple plan never feels like a simplistic morality play . he merely harnesses that energy into scenes of superbly crafted tension , where the moments before critical decisions linger with almost unbearable anticipation . raimi allows you to feel the weight of every bad choice , every life-threatening turning point . it's a thriller as full of genuine dread as anything a major studio has produced in recent years . it's also a thriller full of genuine pathos , thanks to a masterful supporting performance by billy bob thornton . as confused as he is physically grotesque , he provides the sense of emotional consequence most plot-driven thrillers lack . the one drawback to thornton's intense work is that he makes his castmates look weak by comparison ; bridget fonda's calculating sarah rings particularly false at times . a simple plan overreaches its grasp a bit during the final act when a sinister figure arrives to threaten the plan , but by then raimi and smith have gotten you so wrapped up in what their characters will do next that you're willing to follow wherever they lead . smith's first-person narrative in written form made this a tale of one man's descent . on the screen , a simple plan lets you identify with every character and experience the chilly , chilling dark night of several souls . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line "" subscribe "" .",SRe

"" see , he is saying , you too could hang around these guys and degrade yourself just like these women . it's a message that we certainly could have done without . many of the scenes have "" staged "" written all over them . one of the groups , for example , shows us a copy of good will hunting to prove that they watch more than just gangster movies . the performers , in one of their many commercial moments , brag that hip-hop outsells all other types of music . this , for all i know , may be completely true . but their saying it smacks more of gratuitous self-promotion than anything else . let me remind fiore that good documentaries can appeal to a wide audience . this one ignores that rule entirely in favor of cheap theatrics . and , as i've already said , this film doesn't deliver as it should even for its intended audiences . it is also haphazardly edited and poorly shot . many much better films than this one have been unable to obtain a theatrical release , so it is a shame to see this one getting released to theaters . it should have gone directly to video . backstage runs 1 : 39 .",SRh
"for what it's worth , i correctly guessed the identity of the killer in scream 2 . . . well , sort of . i suppose i should feel satisfied at my own cleverness , since dimension and the makers of scream 2 have put so much effort into keeping that piece of information secret . even more so than in the original scream , writer kevin williamson goes to ridiculous extremes to keep the audience guessing whodunnit , so ridiculous that the film becomes too focused on the one thing which should have been least important . as a horror film , it's a solid piece of work ; as a satire , it's frequently hilarious . as a mystery , it tries way , way , _way_ too hard . jermaine ? marlon ? tito ? if you can keep the suspects straight without a press kit , more power to you . williamson often seems so concerned with turning every live body in sight into a potential suspect that he lets that question overwhelm everything else . it all builds to a revelatory climax drawn out so long past the point of diminishing returns -- loaded with confessions , motives and false finishes -- that you can't even see the point of diminishing returns from there . i'm being a bit harder on scream 2 than it might deserve , because that one big problem may be the only real problem . williamson's satirical darts are expertly targeted , not just at horror film cliches or the "" inevitable inferiority "" of sequels , but at the original film itself . the film-within-a-film "" stab "" provides a few wonderful moments , as do the audience reactions to some of the more improbable situations ( e . g . the dialogue is sharp , smart and not at all afraid of naming names ( cox's "" friends "" co-stars david schwimmer and jennifer aniston are among those skewered ) , a perfect counter-point to wes craven's crafty suspense scenes . if you're not ready to crawl out of your skin when campbell crawls across the unconscious form of her tormentor , it's time for a pulse check . scream 2 is so entertaining both as a chiller and as a chuckler that the lack of attention to those elements is a frustration . kevin williamson is carving out a new genre for himself which certainly seems to be finding an audience -- both screams and i know what you did last summer take off with the radical notion that umasking the monster is a good idea . there's just something deflating about a tense , comic horror film that turns into a scooby-doo episode . williamson has too much talent as a writer of comedy to keep getting side-tracked by conventions , even if they're conventions he's helping to re-create . scare us or make us laugh . . . we know you can do both . just keep the mystery machine parked at the curb . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line "" subscribe "" .",SRe
"first of all , let's get the obvious question out of the way . however , while moore's body may be the movie's primary selling point , the film tries to do more than just display naked breasts . the heart of striptease is a satirical examination of those who frequent strip clubs , and this makes it profoundly different from showgirls , which embraced those aspects of american culture that striptease lampoons . unfortunately , striptease's satirical bent , while aimed not only at the sexist attitudes of those who patronize topless joints , but at politicians , right-wing religious fanatics , and lawyers , is unfocused and lacks the requisite viciousness . it's just one aspect of a muddled , overly-long motion picture that can't decide whether it wants to be a comedy or a drama . ultimately , the overabundance of ineffective dramatic moments hurts the movie . the situation is just too improbable and silly to carry any dramatic weight . one of the supposed comic elements of striptease is burt reynolds' offensive , fatuous character . this is an unsavory man , and reynolds plays him in a creepy , unsettling manner . but , if it's difficult to laugh at reynolds , the same can't be said about ving rhames . in his role as shad , the eager beaver's bouncer , rhames' deadpan , matter-of-fact style ( similar to the one he used in pulp fiction ) is consistently hilarious . moore is fine in this role , although more attention will be paid to her physical attributes than her acting . she's a little out of her depth in the dramatic sequences , although that's only one of the reasons they don't work ( the script being the primary culprit ) . young rumer willis , who received a lot of notoriety before she was born as a result of moore's vanity fair cover , displays some promise with her unaffected performance . despite being designed to mock those who leer , striptease does some leering of its own . several lengthy topless dance sequences are shot in an energetic and provocative manner . it's easy to be cynical about this film's motives , especially considering how drastically andrew bergman's script has watered down the most biting aspects of carl hiaasen's novel . striptease is a curious mix of eroticism , comedy , and drama that , instead of blending into a pleasing whole , has a tendency to separate and curdle .",JBe

"screenplay : neil gaiman , adapted from the screenplay by hayao miyazaki . director : hayao miyazaki . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( violence , profanity , adult themes ) running time : 136 minutes . somehow , somewhere , this whole "" anime "" wave has left me behind . sure , the japanese animation style is distinctive , but it strikes me that the form has not progressed radically in the 30 years since "" speed racer . "" though the backgrounds may have become richer , there's still a vaguely anglicized blandness to the character design , a strange lack of fluidity to the acrobatic movements . when the japanese smash princess mononoke made its way to our shores , it was spoken of as the future of animation . i was skeptical that it would bring anything that wasn't already the past of anime . from an animation standpoint , i still think that's true , though princess mononoke does have some striking imagery . the real revelation in the film is the depth and complexity of its mythology and storytelling , which manage to overcome the problems with the human story . in case there is any confusion on the subject , let's be clear that princess mononoke is a film for adults . it also maintains an adult tone in the set-up of its mystical world , with gods who can be petulant , violent and even just plain stupid ( a cosmology far more in keeping with most ancient civilizations' mythologies than disney's benign pantheisms ) . most impressive , miyazaki keeps his story free of the didacticism so common in films with environmental themes . rare is the tale that suggests industry could be a co-existing entity in nature , rather than an inherent evil . princess mononoke is so engrossing as both legend and lesson that you wish it could treat its characters with more care . the line readings by the english actors are flat and constricted , performances set to a stopwatch of mouth movements instead of to the needs of the scene . and then there's the dialogue , which generally ranges from the annoyingly literalist ( characters seem incapable of looking at a thing without calling out its name ) to the purely giggle-inducing ( i don't believe i'll ever embrace unreservedly a film that includes the line , "" forest spirit , we give you back your head "" ) . princess mononoke at times appears to be an animated variation on this year's more ballyhooed version of mythopoetics over substance , the phantom menace . still , there is something compelling about the look of princess mononoke , more so than i was expecting . the design of the supernatural characters is always intriguing , from the writhing worm-bodies of the demons to the pillsbury doughboy-cum-tiki-idol sprites called the kodamas ; the battlefields are arresting in their gore-spattered silence . indeed , silence plays an unexpectedly effective role in this epic film , giving it a sense of reverence . there's just the problem of those darned people , whose homogeneity in word and countenance hinders an otherwise stellar effort . anime may be more or less what it used to be , but at least the storytelling behind it is growing up . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .",SRe

"french director eric rohmer's third film is a coming-of-age story , comically looking at the human condition . the beauty in the film is in the natural way the slight story evolves and how tense it gets when love and desire become the main topics that are burning in these very ordinary characters' minds . rohmer is making sport of the adults and how phony they are . the only one who talks with a straight tongue is pauline . the charm in the story is how after all the gossip and lies and perversions pauline sees , she grows up that summer and sees through all the deceits of the adults . rohmer does it without a strong plot but by his ability to have the characters play out who they are in a realistic way , letting their words and actions become examples of how they really are . only pauline comes through this vacation with a worthwhile summer romance . the pleasure in the film is in its simplicity , even if it is not that deep of a story . the natural way it was filmed makes it a pleasant viewing experience , probably reminding the viewer of some similar experience they might have had on the beach .",DSc

"few of us who call ourselves "" adults "" truly remember the experience of childhood , except as a dim and distant illusion . oh , we can recall what we did as a child , and often our memories of that period are among our most precious , but , looking back , we view things through the haze of maturity . every once in a while , however , something comes along that breaks through that filter -- a movie , a scene on television , a page in a book , or a moment in real life . jacques doillon's ponette is one such catalyst . by presenting the world through the eyes of a grieving four- year old , ponette manages to do what few motion pictures can -- regress an audience into childhood . i would place ponette in the company of two other recent films that have successfully attempted something similar : dorota kedzierzawska's crows and rebecca miller's angela . in both of those movies , however , the protagonist was older ( 9 in crows , 10 in angela ) , and neither featured a young actress with as much emotional power as victoire thivisol , who plays the title character in this film . ponette works in large part because of its simplicity and realism . the plot is minimal -- just enough to give us a reason to stay with the tiny protagonist for ninety minutes . the film effortlessly takes us into the magical world of a four- year old , where stuffed animals have extraordinary powers , dolls are more than inanimate objects , and god is someone you can talk to and expect an answer from . some of the most memorable moments in ponette center around the innocent conversations of children -- how catholics are different from jews , what it means to be "" single "" , and how eating a certain candy can make you fall in love forever . for more than eighty minutes , ponette continues strongly , but , in the end , writer/director jacques doillon seems at a loss how to end the movie . his choice , while admittedly cathartic , feels like a cheat . the pseudo-realistic , almost-documentary quality of the film evaporates ; ponette's final scenes jar us out of the fragile reverie generated by what preceded them . fortunately , the contrived ending does little to dampen my enthusiasm for the picture as a whole . when i recall ponette , the first thing i think of is the heartbreakingly pure performance of young victoire thivisol . this is the kind of portrayal that would be labeled as a standout from an actor of any age , but , from someone who's only four , it's astonishing . a share of the credit must be lavished upon doillon -- it takes a masterful film maker to elicit this kind of unforced performance from a child . had thivisol shown a hint of artifice , ponette would not have worked . the strength and consistency of her acting keeps this film on a high level . even if the movie was not so moving and evocative , it would be worth viewing simply for the character that thivisol brings to life .",JBe

"when it comes to favorite christmas tales on the screen , there are probably two . there's no confusion about the first , because there is only one it's a wonderful life . in fact , frank capra's classic is so expertly wrought that no one has even attempted a big screen remake . the second is a little more problematic , because there have been many worthy takes on charles dickens' a christmas carol . in 1984 , george c . scott humbugged to memorable effect in a made-for-tv adaptation . but the best-loved and most-remembered version of a christmas carol has to be the 1951 edition of scrooge , with the inimitable alastair sim as london's cruelest miser . sim , a veteran of british stage and screen , started his motion picture career in the mid-'30s and ended it in the early-'70s . sim is not just one of many actors to play the part -- for everyone who has seen the crisply-made black-and-white production , he is the definitive scrooge . at the film's opening , sim radiates cold ; at the end , his giddy exuberance is contagious . in between , we experience many emotions directed towards his character : sadness , anger , and , most strongly , pity . sim makes us feel for scrooge in a way that no other actor has been capable of . take away the lead actor , and this version of scrooge would still have been a credible reworking , with capable performances , a strong atmosphere , and superior costume and set design . the movie was made on an english soundstage in the early 1950s , but the look is of london a century earlier . today , with modern special effects , this would not be as great an achievement as it was more than forty years ago . the black- and-white cinematography , brilliantly achieved by c . pennington- richards , is as crucial to the film's success as any other individual element . rather than making scrooge seem quaint and outdated , the black-and-white approach lends it a sense of eerieness and mystery that no color version has managed to recapture . the plot is faithful to dickens' original tale . ebeneezer scrooge is easily one of the nastiest men in london . sim is supported by an able cast , many of whom are familiar faces . kathleen harrison , whose mrs . dilber was scrooge's comic highlight , had a similarly impressive resume . only michael dolan was hardly ever heard from again . like all uplifting christmas stories , scrooge ends with a flurry of good will and high spirits . but the chief pleasure of watching this version of a christmas carol is not the ending . at a reasonably short 85 minutes , this is nevertheless a complete experience , and the strength and depth of its drama makes it the most memorable of any adaptation of the tale . we may hum along with albert finney , hiss at bill murray , and smile at scrooge mcduck , but none of them compares favorably to sim . when it comes to a christmas carol , perhaps there isn't much of a question about the best version after all ? - ingmar bergman",JBe
"the nightmarish scenes seem surpassed by cinematography techniques , allowing the story to move into the realm of make believe hollywood hokum rather than relying on the viewer's imagination to do the job . the irish-born director , jordan , whose accomplishments include a few first-class films among some disappointments , only proves here , that the horror thriller , perhaps , is not what he is best suited for . his heavy-handed direction , helped only in spoiling a fine cast from doing what it is capable of . jordan's idea of a horror thriller , seems to be in letting the heroine to act in a shrill voice , rather than letting the heroine's nightmare and mental breakdown come down as something internally real . if jordan went down the poetic trail instead of opting for this gobbledy-gook he comes up with , then we might have had a solid film to comment on . it was the only scene in the movie that was able to convey how believable her panic attacks really are . i think he's delusional if he thinks he got a real part in this film . his role is so insignificant , even more so than aidan quinn's , as to make stephen rea , seem less like a star than one of the film's extras . here , he is playing the role of vivian thompson , by making his villain role as campy as he could , managing to give the impression that he is a totally evil pervert , possibly even gay . downey jr . basically brought a sense of the ridiculous to this role , allowing the film to sink lower than than the ordinary hollywood horror film usually does . the film's intellectual theme , if i can loosely use the word intellectual , is a reversal of "" snow white "" , as this time the story is not narrated from the child's point of view , but from the mother's . an adult freudian tale , i suppose . the film just becomes a mess and the acting is constantly shrill . it is a film that can't be saved by good looking photography , or diffuse symbolism , or even by great special effects , but must be viewed wallowing in its own unpleasant reservoir of putrid storytelling .",DSc

"" the movie is extremely predictable . with a title like last of the dogmen , do you think they will find a lost indian tribe ? well , that sure settled that . there are some wonderful parts of the show . first , the dog zip who is played by zip is the sort of a friendly mongrel that every kid would love to have . too bad he is not in all of them . this part shows how strong this show could have been . the movie is set in the big sky area of montana . it spends a lot of time explaining the history of the place and of the indian tribes there . as you watch the gorgeous waterfalls and snow capped mountains all filmed in lovely , slightly hazy and overcast images by karl walter lindenlaub , you want to leave this mediocre show and go immediately and book a flight to montana . well , if you did , please call your travel agent back . oh well , maybe the rockies were booked that summer . beside the great cinematography and nice sets ( trevor williams ) , the music ( david arnold ) is quite dramatic . i wish the actors had gotten a chance to hear the music so they would have been more inspired . berenger and hershey are mediocre at best . the indian actors are never challenged and so show us little in the way of acting . overall , the problem in the movie is that it takes itself way too seriously . i kept waiting for murphy to lighten things up a bit . there is a great opportunity for a real romance between the leads , but not in this serious show . a little more realism and humanity would have helped . there is a single , token scene thrown in where the indians are having a comedy fest , but that scene came out of left field and did not fit with the tone of the rest of the film . not surprising , the end is overly dramatic and the least interesting and most predicable part of the plot . among many of its implausibility's , why when disaster is eminent would people set around and slowly converse about alternatives . they looked not like a tribe of warriors , but a bunch of octogenarian professors sitting around debating what to do while the building they are in is being set on fire . give these warriors some energy , please ! the narrator admonishes the audience that "" sometimes you have to put your faith in what you can't see . in what you wish .

"is a light-hearted , quirky romantic romp about a date-from-hell . it most decidedly is not . it is a dark , disturbing and almost painfully honest character study which will have many viewers shifting uncomfortably in their chairs . the sensational performances of karen sillas and tom noonan should have added up to a sensational film , but they don't quite . in adapting his two person stage play , noonan manages both to under-direct and to over-direct , sacrificing much of the story's potential entertainment value for a more serious tone which simply doesn't ring quite as true . the first half of what happened was . . . , which establishes the characters through the mundane , is by far its most effective . it's a beautiful and sensitive performance , and jackie's genuineness provides a perfect counterpoint to michael's intellectual reserve , as he tries to maintain the upper hand through sarcasm without even knowing it . it soon becomes clear that jackie is far more perceptive than michael , and as the power dynamic shifts , michael crumbles . the development of this shift through the dinner is fascinating , if almost too understated . however , noonan is not content to deliver a sort of my dinner date with andre , and it is when the script takes an abrupt left turn into psychodrama that the film falters . noonan simply takes the scene too far ; children's voices whisper in the background , the camera shoots through the windows of a dollhouse , and sillas is lit with flickering candles like a voodoo priestess . the self-conscious arsty-ness of noonan's direction takes a serious scene and makes it almost a self-parody . michael's big breakdown is also played far too broadly . eventually begins too feel extremely scripted , losing the pinpoint honesty which had been its strength . is that it is much more interesting when its observations about human interaction are inspiring nervous laughter than when they are supposed to be inspiring serious contemplation . stories based on big emotional confrontations between characters are tricky to transfer from the stage to the screen . noonan only got it half right .",SRe

"rarely has 1933 st . louis been so real . many period pieces give only token acknowledgment to the era in which they take place , but king of the hill has the great depression woven inextricably throughout . flawless detail is an undeniable asset . american heart , this boy's life , and searching for bobby fischer are a few of the better ones , but none is as impressive as king of the hill , perhaps because none has quite as simple a tale to tell . there is much in king of the hill to enthrall . the characters--even those we don't see much of--are rich , and the situations are , for the most part , entirely believable ( i had a little trouble with a scene involving a runaway car , but that was the only sequence that struck a false note ) . soderbergh has carefully developed this movie to draw out the drama without resorting to tired plot devices . the fact is , aaron's story , no matter how plain it might initially seem , is powerful in its simplicity . of course , to do justice to the plot , an effective young actor was needed to play aaron . jesse bradford's performance is natural and unforced and we never get the sense that he's doing more than reacting to circumstances . the resonance of scenes with these two is remarkable . while no one else has nearly as much screen time as bradford , the young actor has established actors supporting him . eichhorn takes pains to bring sympathetic realism to a small role . adrien brody gives an energetic performance as lester , aaron's best friend and mentor . the two are obviously intimate , yet they appear to have only contempt for one another . mcgovern , like karen allen as aaron's teacher , is underused . it's amazing how something so deceptively uncomplicated can be so effective . the narrative is relatively straightforward ; soderbergh doesn't employ any unusual chronologies . as in life , there are a few unanswered questions at the end of king of the hill , but most of these deal with peripheral issues and in no way detract from the satisfaction imparted by the film . done with less mastery , this could have been just another run-of-the-mill coming of age story .",JBe
"the second craft the loyal bond audience knows in an instant that it is spectre up to its old tricks and not the russians . the 1967 film you only live twice has arguably its most surprising moment during the opening credits . although it is based on an ian fleming novel , the screenplay is by none other than roald dahl , the classic author of such dark children's tales as matilda and james and the giant peach . no one could ever read one of his children's books without being mesmerized by his shockingly bleak but highly literate writing . even more surprising than his being chosen to adapt a bond novel is that none of dahl's gifts for dark humor or sparkling writing is evident . although the script is good , it is a direct descendent of all of the preceding bond scripts and breaks no new ground .

"i don't think any american filmmaker in my lifetime has had his personal life as closely associated with his films as woody allen . the compulsively auto-analytical allen created a classic film persona , but he also created a monster : a body of work constantly being read for clues about its creator . at first , it may sound like another apologia for the artist as world-class clod , a la deconstructing harry , but there's actually something more going on in the character of emmet ray . if he's not the best there is at his art , he may not be able to justify his self-imposed isolation from emotional connection . i'm coming to believe that sean penn may be the most talented american actor alive . penn does so many things right as emmet that it suddenly becomes evident that allen doesn't quite know how to handle it when an actor can make his script seem irrelevant . the light-hearted structure , with jazz scholars commenting talking-head style on emmet's misadventures , becomes jarring and distracting as emmet's story unfolds . episodes like emmet's attempt to con an amateur talent contest or his role in a botched hold-up ( told in three possible variations ) feel like forced attempts at giving the film a woody allen sensibility . only when allen holds penn unexpectedly in the dead center of a reaction shot -- a crucial exchange with another character where you'd usually expect a cutaway -- does it appear the director understands what he has working for him . samantha morton has also received plenty of praise for her role as a mute laundress with whom emmet has a lengthy relationship , and it's certainly an impressive physical performance . it's also clear how much morton is contributing to the story when she leaves the story , only to be replaced as primary romantic interest by the gratingly mannered uma thurman . but this is a jazz odyssey that works thanks to a stunning lead performance of a fascinating character , in spite of a structure always on the verge of sabotaging that character . you might suspect that the notoriously private allen was using sweet and lowdown as a first attempt to really open himself up emotionally on screen , but found it so awkward that he had to keep telling jokes . or maybe he's just an imperfect filmmaker who cast a great actor in an imperfect film . naaaaahhhh . . . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .",SRe

"" unfortunately , as good as girl 6 is with the fine points , the larger brushstrokes are erratic . lee may have a keen sense of setting and dialogue , but his characterization is off . other than judy , no one has any depth , and even she isn't afforded much development . theresa randle ( sugar hill , malcolm x ) is okay in the role , but not a revelation . unlike exotica , which cut deeply into the motivations of those who work in and frequent strip clubs , this film is content to skim the surface of a similar industry . one scene of poignant disillusionment notwithstanding , judy's burgeoning addiction to the illusory aspects of her job is used more as a plot device than a means of exploring her psyche . the question is raised , although lee doesn't really probe it . while girl 6 is considerably more effective than showgirls at exploring the issue , there are times when this film seems like the proverbial triumph of style over substance . cinematographer malik hassan sayeed , who worked with lee on clockers , uses a battery of odd camera angles and experimental shots . most of these work on a purely visual level , but their attempts to telegraph emotional states are less successful . the highlights of the film are a trio of parody fantasies . give lee credit for using madonna and tarantino in roles they're capable of playing . if nothing else , girl 6's perspective of the industry is fascinating . the stereotype is that they're ugly , wrinkled , and haggard . the reality , at least in girl 6 , is somewhere in between . none of the revelations here are especially shocking -- we've seen a lot of this stuff before , anywhere from tv news magazines to robert altman's short cuts ( where jennifer jason leigh played a phone sex girl ) , but lee puts it all together and adds a few twists . unfortunately , while certain aspects of girl 6 are handled with flair , the film's dramatic scope too often isn't compelling enough for subject matter of such rich and varied possibilities .",JBe

"offbeat film director alan rudolph ( chooseme ) makes films that require an acquired taste to fully enjoy . in this fluff piece , which the director calls a "" screwball noir , "" it suffers mostly because its mixture of being a formula noir tale and a comic farce is overtaken by its forced comedy and a story that has little drama in it , but it perks up at times because of the charming performances by all concerned and the constant barrage of wacky dialogue . the film starts off in an amusingly pleasant way , as trixie's banter is laced with continuous malapropisms such as , 'by hook or ladder , ' 'he smokes like a fish , ' and 'nobody is human .

"unless infused with some sort of unique energy , road pictures have become a worn-out genre , as proved by father hood . it's a mystery to me why films like this get made . do we really need to spend ninety minutes following the misadventures of two children and an adult ( who often displays less maturity than his offspring ) as they run around the country trying to get to know one another ? how many hundreds of movies and television shows have had the same plot ? there is little to relieve the tedium of this film , except an impressive performance by little-known actress sabrina lloyd . unfortunately , this is not the movie anyone wants to have it said that they gave their most memorable performance in . if i had cared about the characters , perhaps the unbelievable number of plot implausibilities wouldn't have bothered me as much , but no one in this film manages to grab more than a token amount of sympathy , especially not jack , who is an annoying , arrogant jerk . give patrick swayze credit ( if you want to call it that ) for playing this guy with the right amount of sleaze to get the audience to actively dislike him . the two kids have their moments . actually , i should say that lloyd's kelly has her moments . eddie , as played by brian bonsall , a young actor of limited appeal and talent , is pretty much a nonentity . the script tries too hard to manipulate the audience into sympathizing with them , and that immediately put me on guard . movies of substance rarely resort to such blatant emotional trickery . small roles are given to notables like diane ladd and michael ironside , but these two hardly have more than a few moments on screen . halle berry , who's given second billing behind swayze , doesn't have a role that's much more significant . it's an understatement to say that her talent is wasted . on top of all this , as if sitting through this movie isn't a bad enough experience in the first place , the film makers manage to steal away any possible tension through their structuring of the story . father hood comes complete with a social message that's as old as dickens' oliver twist . while i would support a movie that grapples with the problem sensitively and intelligently , this is not that film . it takes a good- guy , bad-guy approach to the situation and presents it from a decidedly singleminded viewpoint designed to stir the viewer's emotions , not make him or her think about the seriousness of what's going on . in fact , the low quality of father hood may actually sabotage the message it's trying to get across . that too was a road film featuring an older , somewhat callous guardian and the two children he was entrusted with . the similarities extend no further than plot structure and character background , because il ladro di bambini is an excellent movie , and viewing it makes the faults of father hood seem that much more glaring . there may not have been many like me , but i was actually impressed by patrick swayze's performance in city of joy . but with the release of this example of ugliness , i may have to admit to being mistaken . and "" mistake "" is a key word here , because that's exactly what this entire production is .",JBe
"not since robert altman's the player has a film been this relentless in its satirical attack . the great white hype takes the boxing industry and rips it open , displaying the rotting , putrid innards for all to see . there are times when this movie is so vicious that it ceases to be funny . while the great white hype has its share of comical , occasionally-hilarious moments , don't expect a non-stop laughfest on par with this is spinal tap . co-writer ron shelton is no stranger to sports movies -- he scripted five before this ( three of which he directed ) : the best of times , bull durham , white men can't jump , cobb , and blue chips . shelton is familiar with the behind-the-scenes machinations , and this knowlege is crucial to the film's success . the great white hype works primarily because its excesses aren't far removed from reality . perhaps the most disturbing thing about the movie is the recognition of how true-to-life the most outlandish and absurd aspects are . that's the question roper's would-be-rival-in-the-ring , marvin shabazz ( michael jace ) would like answered . the pay-per-view revenue for roper's last fight is down -- way down . the money isn't rolling in the way it used to , and sultan knows the reason . they need a white hero -- someone with a "" clean-cut "" , "" all- american "" image . and , sultan adds , if he doesn't exist , "" i'll create him .

"the idea behind synthetic pleasures is fascinating enough : examine how rapid advances in technology are changing culture and civilization . it's a rich and varied subject with more depth than even a lengthy documentary could probe . and , at 83 minutes , synthetic pleasures is not long . that doesn't stop the film from attempting to touch on such varying topics as nanotechnology , artificial intelligence , cryonics , plastic beauty , virtual reality , nootropics , cyber sex , transhumanism , biotechnology , artificial nature , and terminal identity . don't know what some of those terms mean ? well , even after seeing the movie , you probably still won't . synthetic pleasures is a shallow , rapid- fire survey , not an in-depth essay . there's a direct relationship between your ignorance of the material and how much you'll get out of the film . computer-literate , technologically-minded individuals are likely to find much of synthetic pleasures insubstantial and trite . for those of us who are "" in the know "" ( hence , most likely to be attracted by the premise ) , the film doesn't offer any revelations . it rehashes things that we've read about or experienced . on the other hand , those who don't understand how to set the clocks on their vcrs may be in for an eye-opening experience . it's hard not to applaud director iara lee's intentions , even if the results are less-than-satisfying . there's at least enough here to spur a lengthy post-film discussion . unfortunately , any such interaction is likely to be more compelling than the movie itself . one of the most distressing aspects of synthetic pleasures is that when it raises a truly thought-provoking issue , instead of staying with it , the film rushes on . synthetic pleasures asks a lot of questions . will increasing reliance upon computers add to the already-pervasive sense of alienation ? does a controlled life make for a better life , or does the unexpected make life worth living ? however , not only are none of these questions answered , the film doesn't offer much of an opinion about them . we get occasional sound bytes from talking head experts , but that's all . the film mentions so many issues that it can't help piquing everyone's curiosity at some point . for example , if you're wondering how close we are to the implant devices of strange days or the holodeck of star trek , synthetic pleasures has something to say . visually , the film is unspectacular . consisting mainly of crude computer animation , synthetic pleasures' look rapidly grows tedious . since most of the information comes through a series of short interviews and the voiceover narration , it's possible to close your eyes and not miss much . for a movie that's about cutting-edge technology , it's ironic ( although not surprising , considering the small budget lee had ) that the presentation is so technically limited . essentially , synthetic pleasures is an mtv-style documentary . when it comes to subject breadth , the movie is in good shape , but at no time does it attempt anything more ambitious than skimming the surface . unfortunately , it's underneath , beyond synthetic pleasures' scope , where the really good stuff lies .",JBe
"director : steve buscemi . screenplay : steve buscemi director of photography : lisa rinzler . running time : 96 minutes . palookaville ------------ // skip it director : alan taylor . screenplay : david epstein . director of photography : john thomas . running time : 92 minutes . when two films as thematically similar as trees lounge and palookaville appear virtually on top of one another , you have to take a look around at the society which inspired them . americans have always rooted for underdogs , but usually they like their underdogs to come out on top . what do we make of a pair of movies , both set in the tri-state area , which turn mere economic survival as an act of heroism ? trees lounge and palookaville may be responses to an urban america where desperation is de rigeur , but both films struggle to make black comedy out of bleak tragedy , largely because they take our sympathies for granted . there is a detached verisimilitude to the people and situations in trees lounge -- the indulgent bartender ( carol kane ) ; the barroom conversations where strangers become best friends or lovers in the space of a few hours -- which keeps it just interesting enough to earn the benefit of the doubt for a while . buscemi gives his characters full histories , and peppers the film with quirky moments like the repeatedly thwarted efforts of one young boy to buy ice cream , yet the payoffs are rather unsatisfying . trees lounge cruises along , building up atmosphere like a film in search of a tom waits soundtrack , but when it is all said and done you might wonder what buscemi wanted us to make of his cast of not-so-beautiful losers . although he manages to get you interested in what _might_ happen to them , he is not as successful at getting you to care about what _does_ happen to them . that's more than you can say about the palookas in palookaville . palookaville was inspired by a collection of short stories ( by italian writer italo calvino ) , and it feels every bit of it . there is a real lack of narrative momentum in palookaville , as stories bob and weave around the characters , giving them just enough personality ( jerry's sweet tooth , sid's soft spot for dogs ) to make it evident that they needed more . kim dickens has a few nice moments as russ's young girlfriend , but our three protagonists are never quite as sympathetic as they are pathetic . i suppose that is what makes palookaville even more disappointing than trees lounge : writer david epstein seems to assume that we will feel for his characters simply because they are in financial trouble . there are moments in palookaville when its serious turns make it clear that there is a statement about desperate times lurking beneath the attempts at gallows humor , yet there is little effort to show that the predicaments of jerry , sid and russ are beyond their control . palookaville makes the mistake of asking us to identify with three men who don't even seem to be trying , who surrender at any sign of difficulty . yes , it's rough out there , as both trees lounge and palookaville do an adequate job of presenting , but most of us already know that . social consciousness still requires a story , and characters with a motivation to make themselves -- and not just their bank accounts -- better .",SRe

"inventive animated tale produced by george lucas and directed by john korty and charles swenson . fast , witty story isn't for all children , especially those who won't have patience for its unique look and flippant , incidental storyline . visually , film is a combination of rainbow-hued watercolors , pen and ink , live action , and still photographs . its endearingly scrappy look is matched by its throwaway dialogue - i can imagine this being the kind of cartoon robert altman might produce . hip characters provide many laughs , especially overenthusiastic superhero rod rescueman ( james crenna ) , and a nonchalant fairy godmother ( judith kahan kampmann ) . there's also the nominal lead character ralph , a thing that looks like an extra from yellow submarine ( voice actor lorenzo music ) . film's main basis for characterization is to play against stereotype - an idea we're overly familiar with now , but don't mind in this case because the whole production has such an easygoing feel about it . the animators slip in many visual gags , mostly to do with film and television - one of the characters is an aspiring actress , another an aspiring writer , another an aspiring heroic lead . most interesting visual effects occur when we see a nightmare activated in the world of the rushers . x-status : status : o australia , 1995 u . s . release date : 2/97 ( limited ) running length : 1 : 45 mpaa classification : no mpaa rating ( sex , nudity , mature themes ) theatrical aspect ratio : 1 . 85 : 1 cast : john lynch , jacqueline mckenzie , colin friels , deborra-lee furness , daniel daperis director : michael rymer producers : timothy white and jonathan shteinman screenplay : michael rymer cinematography : ellery ryan music : john clifford white u . s . distributor : cinepix film properties the reason ? despite certain thematic similarities , shine is an upper ; angel baby is a downer . depressing or not ( i suppose it depends on your point-of-view ) , there's no denying angel baby's emotional power . this is the sort of film that lays it all on the line , and requires the kind of intense commitment from its lead actors that few motion pictures demand . the sheer intensity of their emotion has disastrous consequences , for , although harry and kate believe their love is strong enough to overcome anything -- even insanity -- the reality is far less romantic or forgiving . watching this film , i was reminded strongly of a couple of recent motion pictures : jude ( which is based on thomas hardy's jude the obscure ) and breaking the waves . both of those films , like angel baby , deal with the effects of a powerful , all-consuming love . in one way or another , both of these threads are echoed in angel baby , which explores not only the transcendent power of love , but its limitations , as well . writer/director michael rymer's imperfect narrative contains a few contrived missteps , but the characters and their relationships are so effectively conceived and expertly realized that it's difficult to fault the film much for this . angel baby is well-focused on an emotional level , and i found myself unexpectedly touched by this unconventional love story . there's far more than mental illness and its attendant pain to harry and kate's relationship . the tenderness , eroticism , and ecstasy of their interaction leaves the most forceful impression . for those watching the film in the united states , it's worth acknowledging an unusal bit of cross-cultural trivia . having seen angel baby , it's easy for me to understand why major distributors like fine line and miramax stayed away . much like breaking the waves , it's a raw , intense , carnal film that will appeal most strongly to adventurous movie-goers . actually , it's ironic that the very qualities which scared off everyone except cinepix film properties are those that give angel baby its unique identity and make it such a compelling viewing experience .",JBe

"director : steven zaillian . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( adult themes , profanity ) running time : 118 minutes . for those unfamiliar with the american legal system -- and count it among your blessings if you are one of them -- it is not generally the stuff of which great drama is made . it is a thing of motions , pleadings , depositions and causes of action , of hundreds of hours spent reading thousands of incoming documents , or redacting thousands of outgoing documents . it is a war of attrition played out in conference rooms , only rarely involving tense attorney-witness confrontations or even-more-tense waits for a verdict . cinematic law is a satisfying fiction ; real law is , for the most part , a laborious game of chicken before an out-of-court settlement . there was every reason to believe that , if anyone could lend a spark to slogging through the legal mire , it would be steven zaillian . this was , after all , the director who made chess both kinetic and poetic in searching for bobby fischer . unfortunately , it pulls all its punches when it comes to giving the story an emotional hook . schlichtmann's conversion from shark to softy is supposed to anchor the film , except that it's far too subtle . in fact , travolta often plays schlichtmann as though his concern is always still about the money , his frustration less about letting his clients down than about letting the big one slip away -- which , frankly , is a more interesting choice . as the film slowly becomes the story of how the woburn case drains all the cash out of schlichtmann and his firm , it slowly drains what little narrative and visual energy it had . certainly much of that energy was supposed to be provided by robert duvall as jerry facher , beatrice's eccentric veteran attorney . i suppose the idea is that he's wily because he passes himself off as such a goof , but the character's tics -- taping up an ancient briefcase covered in snagglepuss decals ; absently bouncing a ball during a phone conversation ; obsessing over the red sox -- are more often distracting than they are entertaining . at least duvall's fussy colorfulness , along with william h . macy's less-mannered breakdown as schlichtmann's nervous accountant , give you something to watch . too often a civil action feels like the sort of lecture in legal maneuvering we see facher give to students at harvard law . it runs out of gas when it runs out of things to tell us , since it lacks characters to engage us . real law makes the appeal of john grisham-esque courtroom melodrama make a lot more sense . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line "" subscribe "" .",SRe

"from the director of the adventures of ford fairlane , renny harlin , we have cutthroat island . it was one of last year's big budget films costing almost $100 million dollars to make . unless it becomes a big hit in the video stores , it is destined to be a megaflop . you can pay three bucks now and see it on pay-per-view . the only difference is he does not have demille's talent . what renny does know how to do is create explosion after explosion . his motto is : when the pace is in danger of slowing a bit , blow up something . this technique can work in a movie with more of a plot , as this year's executive decision , but here it only serves to let people test out their new subwoofers . to renny's credit , he probably made a significant dent in the unemployment rate since there are thousands upon thousands of extras . the election is ultimately decided by a single person , but it does provide an early example of democracy in action . the other problem is the map is in latin , which none of them can read . the show pays only lip service to the idea of a plot . this is a pure swashbuckling action picture . here davis attempts to be a female douglas fairbanks . davis has tremendous fun playing a pirate - wouldn't we all ? too bad the director did not worry more about whether the audience was having fun . about 10 minutes of this is somewhat interesting , but then it is pure repetition . the script by michael frost beckner , bruce evans , and raynold gideon has nothing of value to say . it wastes little time with character development or plot , best to get the actors to the next fight as quickly as possible . the cinematography ( peter levy ) is full of bright lights and strong colors . no expense is spared . i have a friend who looks for plotless action films for watching while working out on his nortictrac , this is perfect for that . if your tv has a knob that turns off the dialog , feel free to do so without worrying about losing out on any content . his die hard 2 is spectacular , and it has a strong narrative drive . it is rated pg-13 which is probably right given the violence level . there is a lot of violence , but it is pretty cartoonish . cutthroat island would be fine for kids say 8 or 9 and up . i was bored silly by it , but it does possess an impressive sound and look . i would advise catching one of those short cable films that talks about the making of the movie instead and skip the show itself . the excerpts suffice . i give the picture a thumbs down and rate it  .",SRh
"a film review by james berardinelli sequels have always been a popular means of cinematic entertainment , even back in the days of the old cliffhanger serials . after all , by using previously-established characters , there's a built- in audience . in recent years , it's almost an axiom that any film grossing $100 million will have a continuation , no matter how ludicrous the premise . the familiarity inherent in a sequel is a double-edged sword . less time can be spent establishing the characters , since we already know them , so it's possible to get into the heart of the story more quickly . on the other hand , comparisons are inevitable , and , with a genuine classic of beauty and the beast's stature , they're not likely to be favorable . no matter how much effort was put into the production of the enchanted christmas , there's no way it could live up to the standards established by its predecessor . as a direct-to-video effort , the enchanted christmas is more than respectable . it's far ahead of the two aladdin tapes , and is arguably better than disney's latest animated theatrical feature , hercules . it goes without saying that we're not getting something of comparable quality to the original beauty and the beast -- the time , effort , and budget are considerably less , and it shows in many ways . surprisingly , the animation is one area that suffers only a minor degradation . for the most part , it's crisp , clean , and smooth . the computer generated sequences featuring the new villain , forte the pipe organ , are impressive . i was frankly impressed by how good the enchanted christmas looks , especially considering the unevenness of the aladdin sequels . the enchanted christmas is clearly aimed at a young audience , with little consideration for the adults who may be watching . the script isn't stupid or insulting , but it lacks the polish and maturity of beauty and the beast . unfortunately , the film makers have added a lot of "" adventure "" to the mix , and , while this aspect of the movie may be fine for younger viewers , more sophisticated viewers will find it routine . as a villain , forte is neither sinister nor frightening ( his inability to move is a distinct flaw ) , although he does get to utter a few delicious lines . they're not bad , but they don't add a lot to the proceedings . the entire principal vocal cast is back , and they're all in fine form . combining well-known voices with familiar animated faces makes watching the enchanted christmas a comfortable , genial experience . it's not a classic , and the videotape won't get the same kind of play afforded to beauty and the beast , but , if only for the chance to spend 70 minutes with old friends , the enchanted christmas is a welcome release .

"paws . claws . gaping maws . pick your favorite ( or least obnoxious ) analogy-inspiring epithet , because no matter how stridently the makers of the ghost and the darkness insist that it is "" based on a true story , "" it owes at least as much to jaws as it does to real life . all right , so there isn't a matt hooper to be found , but don't try to tell me this comparison is a reach , especially when there is a scene in which patterson and remington attempt to attract their prey by laying down what amounts to a chum line around a building where they are lying in wait . ordinarily , it is be a remarkably bad idea for a film in any genre to make such obvious references to the classics of its genre , because they only serve to emphasize that you are not watching a much better movie of the same kind . yet there is something fairly satisfying about the ghost and the darkness , because it is a kind of suspense film you just don't see very often . a force of nature in its own element can be a truly frightening thing ; give that force of nature a vaguely unnatural personality , and you've got the ingredients for one scary piece of work . screenwriter william goldman knows what works in this kind of film , and when the lions are on the prowl in the ghost and the darkness , it is surprisingly gripping . director stephen hopkins ( blown away ) directs his action scenes with efficiency and a sense of barely-controlled chaos , and he is able to make the lions' every appearance a time to scoot to the edge of your seat . he may be no spielberg , but that's even true of spielberg sometimes . the reason the ghost and the darkness never approaches jaws in overall quality is what happens between the attacks . the performances are almost uniformly under-stated , with val kilmer doing solid work as the confident patterson , and john kani and brian mccardie are appealing as two of patterson's colleagues on the bridge project . that is even more true of douglas' remington than it is of the other characters -- he is a hunter with a tortured past whose one moment of introspection is supposed to define his entire personality . douglas is an actor given to playing characters broadly , and even though he is relatively restrained he still appears to be camping it up compared to his co-stars . you never care nearly as much about the individual humans in the ghost and the darkness as you should , because you don't really know who they are . still , at least there _are_ characters in the ghost and the darkness , and at least their confrontations with their adversaries get your adrenaline pumping . there is a tremendous primal appeal to the battle between man and beast , and with cinematographer vilmos zsigmond providing glorious photography and jerry goldsmith turning in one of his most effective recent scores , the ghost and the darkness turns it into solid , suspenseful film-making . perhaps there is less inherent claustrophobic tension when you take the men out of a boat and put them on dry land , but the ghost and the darkness makes sure you understand who has the home field advantage here . you may feel as though you have seen some of this before , but you haven't seen it in a long time , and you might realize that you have been missing it . farewell and adieu to you fair spanish ladies . . .",SRe

"move over , silence of the lambs ! with its rare mixture of intelligent plotting , flawless acting , and start-to-finish tension , copycat is a force to be reckoned with--hopefully both at the box office and when oscars are given out next spring . it amazes me that an entry from this genre , which is normally known for pointless gore and contrived storylines ( see--or rather don't see--don't talk to strangers ) , has turned out a motion picture this keen and complex . it's a difficult task to perfect this sort of story . there are so many areas where the script can fail that it's astounding how seamlessly copycat overcomes all obstacles . there are no stupid characters , contrived resolutions , or deus ex machinas . and the movie doesn't play games with the villain's identity--we aren't left wondering whether he's one of the supposed "" good guys . "" like seven , copycat isn't concerned with whodunnit , but why they did it and how they will strike next . in contrast to the brad pitt/morgan freeman movie , however , this picture has a rock-solid storyline with no gaping holes in logic . i've never been a big fan of sigourney weaver , but what she accomplishes here is impressive . i can't help wonder how much better death and the maiden would have been had she turned in a similar caliber performance there . from the opening scene in copycat , weaver has a good sense of dr . hudson , and she holds onto the character through all the emotional ups and downs . this is doubtlessly the actresses' best work to date . strong-willed , tough , and extremely competent , her mj monahan is the kind of smart , multi-layered role actors relish , and hunter is on target with her portrayal . this is a contained , dynamic performance without a hint of overacting . in many ways , what the actress does here exceeds what she managed in jane campion's new zealand period drama . the supporting cast is solid . dermot mulroney projects a likable cockiness as monahan's partner . the worst thing that can happen in a movie like this is for the characters to be a step behind the audience . that's not the case in copycat , where the viewer is in synch with what's occurring on-screen . tension and atmosphere are excellent , and director jon amiel pays careful attention to detail . parts of this film are frightening , and will have many viewers either on the edge of their seat or hiding their eyes . and , unlike in many so-called thrillers , the ending is not a let- down . comparisons with silence of the lambs are inevitable , but this movie is no mere copycat of jonathan demme's 1991 feature--it's a well-crafted improvement .",JBe

"disney's 32nd animated feature film is its darkest since the black cauldron , and , in many ways , a departure from the light-heartedness of the little mermaid , beauty and the beast , and aladdin . there are moments of fun and humor , to be sure , but the undercurrent is of a far more serious , "" adult "" nature . but it's never that easy to escape the past . . . . death , something not really touched on in the last three animated disney tales , is very much at the forefront of the lion king . it is a chilling moment that is reminiscent of a certain incident in bambi . the film also contains a fair share of violence , including a rather graphic battle between two lions . parents should carefully consider before automatically taking a child of , say , under seven years of age , to this movie . scar , simba's treacherous uncle , is the latest in a long line of disney antagonists . gone is the buffoonery that has marked the recent trio of ursula , gaston , and jafar . the cold-hearted manner in which he causes mufasa's death lets us know that this is not a lion to be trifled with . an all-star cast was selected to supply the lion king's voices . jeremy irons , with his dry british accent , is a critical element of scar's personality . the animation , as expected from any disney film , is superior . as usual , as much attention is given to small background details as to foreground principals . lighting and color are used to highlight the shifting tone of the picture ( the sunny warmth of mufasa's kingdom to the dreary barrenness of scar's ) , and the animators have never lost sight that their subjects are not human . since 1989's the little mermaid , the musical element of any disney animated picture has been nearly as important as the visual one ( the three previous movies have garnered a total of twelve grammy awards ) . for the lion king , menken is absent . two of the five john/rice songs are rather unimpressive ( "" i just can't wait to be king "" and "" hakuna matata "" ) , one is decent ( "" be prepared "" ) , and two are quite good ( "" circle of life "" and "" can you feel the love tonight "" ) .

"the sweet hereafter is film maker atom egoyan's most compelling movie to date . amplifying many of the themes explored in his previous outing , exotica , the canadian director/writer/producer shows the powerful effects of grief and anger on a community devastated by an unspeakable tragedy . during the course of this 110-minute , emotionally- turbulent experience , egoyan doesn't ask any easy questions or propose any pat answers . this is film making at its most powerful : drama capable of shaking the soul , yet free of even the slightest hint of manipulation , sentimentality , or mawkishness . the movie has an impact that extends far beyond the walls of a movie theater ? a quality shared by a distressingly few of today's releases . egoyan began making films with 1984's next of kin , a critical success that earned him a nomination for canada's best director genie award . he followed next of kin with family viewing , speaking parts , the adjuster , and calendar , all of which shared certain common traits , including a wildly elliptical style , themes of emotional isolation , and a degree of distance between the characters and the audience . egoyan's early movies , although intellectually stimulating and fascinating to observe from a critical standpoint , were emotionally dissatisfying . however , the director's next effort , the much-lauded exotica , broke down the character/audience barrier , and , at the time , proved to be egoyan's most challenging effort . yet , as forceful as exotica was , it was only an appetizer for the sweet hereafter . as with all of the other egoyan-directed movies , the sweet hereafter involves more than one storyline , although the internal connections are less oblique here than in the previous features . this could easily be viewed as egoyan's most commercial work thus far . it is certainly his most accessible . there are those who would equate words like "" commercial "" and "" accessible "" with the term "" creative compromise , "" but nothing could be further from the truth . although egoyan's methods may have become more mainstream , his message is richer and more complex than ever . the scene of the bus sinking into the water ? a stark , simple shot ? is one of the most painfully effective and disturbing sequences in any film this year . the impact is further enhanced by presenting the fatal moment from the perspective of an impotent father . death has become such a cheap , bloody commodity in modern movies that viewing a scene like this is a revelation . since egoyan eschews linear storytelling by allowing time to be fluid rather than fixed , we don't see the actual accident until midway through the movie . the sweet hereafter is based on the novel by russell banks , but egoyan has infused it with his own inimitable style . the most intriguing character is mitchell . the best-developed of all of the sweet hereafter's numerous multifaceted individuals , mitchell proves to be a sympathetic figure even though his influence is negative . as always , egoyan has assembled a top-notch cast . ian holm paints a powerful and stirring portrait of mitchell as a haunted , hurting figure whose inner torment touches our hearts . it is during this scene , more than any other , that the audience truly connects with a character that , under other circumstances , might be worthy of disdain . most of the other performers are egoyan regulars . in addition to portraying nicole , polley contributes the vocals to many of the songs heard throughout the film , including the one that plays over the closing credits . one of the many tangential aspects of the sweet hereafter is to illustrate the shallowness of the numerous john grisham movies . compared to egoyan's thoughtful and potent examination of the role of a lawyer in society , even the rainmaker , the best adaptation of a grisham novel to date , seems flat and unconvincing . egoyan has given us a powerful motion picture that resonates on every level . the most amazing thing about the sweet hereafter is not the style , the acting , or the cinematography ( all of which are exceptional ) , but the way the film successfully juggles so many themes , persuading us to reflect upon them all before the 110 minute running time is up . this is truly a great film ? easily one of 1997's best .

"director jean-luc godard's contempt ( le mepris ) has been hailed by some critics as one of the best films ever made . the dialog remains more romantic than sexual although with brigitte bardot playing the part of the wife , camille javal , the audiences at the time of the picture's release may have had trouble concentrating on the lines spoken . ( the modicum of female rear nudity may have been a bit shocking at the time , but the movie is quite tame by today's standards . ) godard's film wants to challenge your mind and not titillate your senses , hence the few nude scenes are there more for realism than exploitation . brigitte bardot gives an incredible performance as the 28-year-old typist who does not have a clue about what she wants in life . the film works precisely because she convinces us of her disdain for most aspects of her life , especially her marriage . what could he have said or done that made her feel thus ? when odyssey's director fritz lang , played by the great director himself , starts talking about how cultured the performance will be , jerry will have none of it .

"snatch is the second feature film by writer and director guy ritchie , who blasted onto the film scene a couple of years ago with his audacious lock , stock and two smoking barrels . his latest movie is a hyper-violent , screwball comedy that doesn't pull any punches . and it's fun for a time until the repetition factor sets in . coming from the more-is-always-better school of filmmaking , ritchie tries to fill every fast-paced scene with maximum violence and mayhem . snatch , which has more characters and overlapping stories that you can count , never has a slow moment . in the predictable script , you can probably guess exactly how he will be relieved of the stone . many of the characters , like boris , can take more bullets than the agents in the matrix and still keep on coming . individual incidents are cute although few rise to the level of laugh-out-loud funny . animal rights people may find many of the fighting animal scenes more than they can stomach even if the movie undoubtedly promises that no animals were harmed , etc . as the ending credits roll , the song it plays has the constant refrain , "" ha , ha , ha , ha . the movie is like that -- way too repetitive . snatch runs 1 : 43 . it is rated r for strong violence , language and some nudity and would be acceptable for high school seniors and older .",SRh
"cast : bridget fonda , russell crowe , jim broadbent , d . w . on one level , i appreciated rough magic , because it's an audacious , radical movie that is virtually impossible to classify . on another level , however , i have to admit that large portions of the film simply don't work . pushing boundaries is fine , but rough magic makes a few too many mistakes in its attempts to do so . as a result , the finished product seems more like a confused mismash of conflicting genres than the smooth , seamless parody/fantasy that director clare peploe was undoubtedly aiming for . rough magic , which takes place sometime in the early 1950s , opens as an old-fashioned noir thriller ( with a tinge of satire ) . my approval rating soars 17 points . "" at one point , a character in this film remarks that "" the line between illusion and miracle can grow very thin . "" in rough magic , such lines have been completely obliterated . meanwhile , characters are spouting the hard-bitten dialogue of dime store novels . "" i've been lookin' for you since the day i was born "" and "" life's simple till ya start thinking "" are a couple of memorable examples . the real flaw in rough magic's approach isn't that it has so much fun playing around with our expectations , but that it tries to make a serious point about spirituality . unfortunately , whatever that point is , it never comes across clearly ( unless it's that you should always pay in full when you put gas in the car ) . so there's a heavy dose of the supernatural to be found in rough magic , but the mixture of potboiler and mystical elements can be jarring . part of the problem is undoubtedly bridget fonda , who frequently seems like a fish out of water . there's no debating that fonda is an immensely appealing actress , and , in the right role , she can be mesmerizing . unfortunately , the part of myra is not the right role . to begin with , fonda plays myra like a '90s woman , not a product of the '50s , and her whole rhythm is wrong for anything vaguely noirish ( even in such an openly weird satire ) . to be fair , fonda shines in rough magic's opening moments and during the last thirty minutes , but it's the hour in between that's the problem . it's also interesting to note that this is the third film with similar mystical/spiritual overtones in which fonda has appeared ( the other two being little buddha and touch ) . meanwhile , russell crowe ( virtuosity ) , gives a performance that's as passable as his american accent , but he's playing a two-dimensional hero , so depth doesn't really matter . moffett is adequate as the villain . perhaps the oddest character is dr . ansell , because we're never sure what to make of him . rough magic seems like a good idea that failed to make a seamless transition from the concept stage to the finished product . it's an amalgamation of ingredients that do and don't work , and the overall result left me feeling strangely ambivalent and a little dissatisfied . the film finishes strongly , but something of a bad taste lingers . so , although rough magic has its fair share of mysticism , it's not really all that enchanting .",JBe
"although the films were often easy to dismiss , the actress' consistently fine performances were not . finally , with the ice storm , ricci was given a role of import in a film of substance . ricci's performance is only one reason why don roos' the opposite of sex is a success . this is perhaps the most audacious film of the year to date ( at least among mainstream releases ) , filling the slot left vacant by 1997's in the company of men . the opposite of sex is the kind of daring feature that doesn't open every friday at the local multiplex ; its frank , sometimes politically incorrect approach towards the act and politics of sex is refreshing . and , in addition to dealing with intrinsically provocative material , first-time director roos uses the unique approach of satirizing the conventions of road pictures and dysfunctional family dramas to tell his story . in particular , he has a lot of fun with the voice-over . the glib narrator , deedee truitt ( ricci ) , is aware that she's speaking to a movie audience , and , as a result , can't resist the opportunity to have some fun at the viewer's expense . in her opening monologue , she informs us that "" things get very complicated very quick , and you're going to have trouble getting through it without me talking , "" then , in case we mistake her for a cute-but- misunderstood 16-year old , she warns us that "" i don't have a heart of gold and i don't grow one later . "" at another time , she "" shows "" scenes of things that don't really happen , then laughs at our gullibility for believing them . although deedee is the narrator and , consequently , has the largest speaking part , she's not the film's central character . as comedies go , the opposite of sex is one of 1998's most consistently funny . of course , humor is subjective , and i'm known for being a little warped in that area , so roos' flamboyant , out-on-a-limb approach is perfect for someone like me . the dialogue is crisp and distinctive , occasionally invoking the spirit of something written by kevin smith ( clerks , chasing amy ) . however , it's obvious to roos ( and to us ) that this kind of slick , unconventional style can have trouble sustaining a feature-length movie . no matter how outrageous the tone , it grows tiresome after a while , so the writer/director changes gears during the second half . although the opposite of sex never completely loses its satirical , self-mocking edge , the final 50 minutes are more serious than what precedes them , and the humor is leavened by a couple of earnest , surprisingly-effective messages . one particularly intriguing concept is carl's assertion that maybe sex isn't for recreation or procreation , but for concentration ? that when a man and woman sleep together , the experience attunes them to each other . this is in contrast with deedee's largely-negative view of sex . while ricci's performance in the opposite of sex is the standout , it's not the most surprising example of acting , at least when one considers her previous critical acclaim . lucia proves that kudrow has a rarely-displayed range . so , with ricci and kudrow leading the way , the women in the opposite of sex are far more interesting than the men . martin donovan underplays bill as smart , affable , and bland . ivan sergei plays matt as dumb , affable , and bland . and lyle lovett portrays carl as strange , affable , and bland . the tag line for the opposite of sex is : "" you'll laugh , you'll cry , you'll be offended . "" while that's perhaps overstating the movie's impact , it's not completely off-base . the film manages to mix a portion of successful drama into its primarily-comic foundation , and conservative movie-goers will likely be turned off by the no-punches pulled , occasionally raunchy look at sex . however , with its memorable dialogue , solid performances , and idiosyncratic style , the opposite of sex is sure to be appreciated by those who aren't frightened away by the cinematic equivalent of hot chili .

"writer-director/acting star-artist , takashi kitano , has broken ground from traditional films , taking risks that defy explaining how to classify this very violent and tender film , that sways between the two extremes , and as the critic joel hoberman so astutely states , fireworks is a cross between ozu's late spring and don siegel's dirty harry . kitano is not noted for plot development and for understanding women . his forte is in the raw nerve of his films and the stark beauty of the cinematography . one should expect the unexpected from his films . the violence is brutal and fast-paced . the narrative is told in flashbacks , so any part of nishi's life could pop up on the screen , and what would seem like a commonplace crime story unfolding , deceptively turns out to be much more than that , even as nishi gets revenge on the yakuma's who did this to his friend , unafraid of bringing untold graphic violence to the screen . you better believe that caught my attention . but , if that was all this film was about , the dirty harry description of the film would have been completely apropos . this highly original film , that is at times a masterpiece and other times a grade b- movie , is difficult for me to penetrate what it all means as far as a commentary on japanese culture , but the japanese critics have been critical of his attacks on japanese conformity , while the japanese public accepts him as a popular performer and stage comedian , even if his films have not been as well received in japan as they have been in foreign countries . as far as i am concerned , i prefer ozu , i am more taken with his intellect and perspective , but i can appreciate the artistic direction kitano is taking his violent subject matter to , as i found this volatile film to be something special , but something i can't completely comprehend because i don't really know what he is trying to say , as if that really matters . yet his film is a visual treat to behold , and for that i am grateful and accepting of his work .",DSc
"it's tough to knock a funny film for being not nearly as funny as it could have been -- or thinks it is -- but that's ultimately the problem with drop dead gorgeous . it would be easy enough to call drop dead gorgeous a second-rate gloss on michael ritchie's smile , or a wannabe waiting for guffman , or a half-hearted the positively true adventures of the alleged texas cheerleader-murdering mom ( also , not coincidentally , directed by michael ritchie ) . such criticisms don't do justice to the number of belly laughs this film provides . by the time the talent portion of the competition rolls around -- complete with dog impressions and monologues from soylent green -- drop dead gorgeous has provided enough humor to avoid being buried by comparative criticism . the thing about those comparitive criticisms is that you'd also be right . as scripted by lona williams -- herself a former minnesota beauty contest participant -- the film takes on too many targets to skewer any of them with maximum effectiveness . the peek at pageant contestants finds only the occasional insight , opting instead for broad caricatures and even broader gags . in fact , director michael patrick jann almost always opts for over-the-top , making the documentary set-up seem completely inappropriate . it's impossible to get caught up in drop dead gorgeous's verisimilitude when the action arbitrarily switches to rapid-fire , multiple-angle edits the likes of which i've never seen in any documentary . it's that aggravating refusal to look for genuine humor that makes drop dead gorgeous so frustrating . when it's funny , it's quite entertaining , but there's always the suspicion that it could have been hilarious with a bit of care . every joke made in drop dead gorgeous made me think of a joke missed ; every raucous chuckle called to mind an even better sly snicker . it's like a vaudeville act that will do anything to please the crowd , only it's a vaudeville act that thinks it's a wicked satire . you'll laugh , you'll sigh , you'll think about the better films covering similar subject matter . this may be one of the least satisfying entertaining films of recent years . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .",SRe
"cast : peter pryor , kevin dinovis , jason centeno , elizabeth casey director : kevin dinovis producer : richard goldberg screenplay : kevin dinovis cinematography : jonathan kovel music : christopher matarazzo the fact that kevin dinovis' debut feature , surrender dorothy , won the grand jury prize at the 1998 slamdance film festival should be a warning signal to anyone expecting something even remotely mainstream . surrender dorothy is startling , gripping , disturbing , and out on the film making edge . it's the kind of movie that we don't see enough of because its commercial prospects are so limited . this kind of picture is unlikely to appeal to typical movie-goers ( or , for that matter , even to a significant portion of the art house crowd ) , and , as a result , directors stay away from this sort of in-your-face excursion into psychological deviance and obsession . surrender dorothy betrays its low budget through its 16 mm black- and-white print . rather than detracting from the experience , however , the grainy , almost primitive-looking cinematography enhances the film's effectiveness , lending an almost-documentary quality to the proceedings that offsets the twisted fairy tale quality of the narrative . the movie's look is perfect for the story ; color or even a crisper black- and-white would not have been as effective . the core relationship between trevor and lanh is obviously homosexual , but surrender dorothy isn't a "" gay film . "" the real focus of dinovis' picture is on trevor's obsession . it's frightening to consider the kind of monster that can lurk within the psyche of someone as apparently-ineffectual as trevor . surrender dorothy can also be seen as an autopsy of a universal problem : domestic abuse . trevor is the abuser and lanh is the victim , and , although their roles are nontraditional , the patterns are familiar . the lead actors both give fine performances . peter pryor is completely believable as trevor , the kind of meek person we see every day on the street and in shops , but rarely notice . even more impressive is kevin dinovis , who shows great courage by placing himself in such a controversial role . apparently , dinovis wasn't his own first choice for lanh , but , when the actor originally cast in the part backed out at the last minute , dinovis had no choice if he wanted to make the film . the results are a testament to the sometimes-fortunate twists of fate on an independent movie shoot . dinovis is the perfect lanh/dorothy . surrender dorothy is part dark comedy and part ( david ) lynch- inspired melodrama , although it doesn't fit neatly into either category . it's an assault on political correctness and middle class values , but the underlying message is too urgent to disregard . ultimately , surrender dorothy isn't easy to like ( in much the same way that something in the nature of blue velvet isn't easy to like ) , but it is undeniably powerful . a week after i saw surrender dorothy , it still lingers in my consciousness while movies viewed in the interim have already faded .

"in my opinion , a movie reviewer's most important task is to offer an explanation for his opinion . but with soul survivors , i'm so full of critical rage that this review is liable to turn into a venomous , uncontrollable rant , obligations damned . however , protocol forces me to do otherwise . rarely have i seen a director so thoroughly mishandle material . in his directorial debut , steve carpenter does nothing to provoke the audience into feeling any emotion . when the movie's camerawork isn't pedestrian , it's clich ? d . carpenter's need for close-ups , his camera following sagemiller from behind , drain the movie of any anticipation . we already know what to look for , so why should we be surprised ? and the sense of scary atmosphere , which was recently done so well in the others , is nowhere to be found here . carpenter's script relies on random twists and turns with a minimum of logic and loads of laziness . this is a movie where the ending features one character providing an explanation about the plot to another character , which is one of the lamest screenwriting devices around . and guess what ? this movie has both ! not that the main body of the film , which has sagemiller constantly running in fear or having a nervous breakdown , is anything worthwhile . since there's no captivating dialogue , no character chemistry exists anywhere . that's a huge problem , since the four main characters are supposed to be couples . carpenter can't even get the smutty scenes right , which are becoming more prevalent in pg-13 movies like bring it on and get over it .

"" such an inexcusable credibility blunder , coming so early in the film , immediately puts the viewer in a cynical frame of mind . strangely , there are at least a half dozen scenes in "" josie's account "" that she isn't involved in . this sort of sloppy storytelling is evident throughout . however , the major difference is that , while everything in bryan singer's 1995 feature built logically to the big revelation , here , the "" shocking "" twist feels like a cheat -- something intended to throw the viewer off balance and obfuscate several of the movie's plot deficiencies . believe me , this particular device works a lot better with a well thought-out script like the usual suspects than something silly and derivative like the rich man's wife . whatever its faults , the rich man's wife is nicely-photographed . crafts an effectively dark and edgy mood . a lot of this film takes place at night , and wexler uses this to his advantage , capturing several memorable shots on small , moonlit country roads winding through a brooding forest . alas , john frizzell's melodramatic score frequently spoils the effect . as josie , halle berry is appealing , which is the most desirable trait for an "" innocent victim "" character . peter greene , who has been typecast as a sicko/psycho with appearances in clean , shaven , pulp fiction , and under siege 2 , isn't required to explore virgin territory . there's an unpleasant scene where cole slashes open his palm then licks the blood out of the wound . christopher mcdonald is suitably abrasive as tony , but , like greene , the material doesn't challenge him . the rich man's wife is the sort of movie that should have gone straight to video . it's not fundamentally all that different from the andrew stevens/shannon tweed thrillers that are popular with the rental crowd . and , although this picture aspires to be a serious film noir , all it does is remind us how easily a formulaic premise can be transformed into a hopeless mess .",JBe

"in 1990 , the mpaa introduced the nc-17 rating to provide an outlet for legitimate adult fare--non-pornographic motion pictures with content deemed too strong for the under-17 crowd . the first movie released with an nc-17 was henry and june , whose financial failure was widely blamed on the new rating . after that , all potentially-lucrative films receiving an nc-17 made the cuts required by the mpaa to earn an r . now , in 1995 , there's showgirls , the most significant test of the nc-17's commercial viability to date . helmed by paul verhoeven ( total recall , basic instinct ) and written by joe eszterhas ( jagged edge , basic instinct ) , this movie is going into wide release with the adult rating . too bad it's one of the worst films of the year . curiosity will undoubtedly pull in a fair number of movie-goers , especially on the first weekend . other than that , though , there's nothing about showgirls to lure viewers . this film is like a shiny , red apple that's rotten to the core--despite slick direction and a glossy sheen , it reeks of decay . showgirls isn't a good drama , a good thriller , or even good pornography . it's hard to imagine that the picture will appeal to anyone , and unclear whether there's any future for the nc-17 rating if showgirls rightfully bombs at the box office . saved by the bell actress elizabeth berkley has the lead role , and her lack of feature experience shows . she was obviously chosen more for what she would show than for acting ability . and , by the end of the two-hour plus running time , there's very little berkley hasn't given the audience at least a peek at . verhoeven has never been a subtle director , and his fixation with naked body parts makes one wonder if he might not have potential as a hard-core director . showgirls is a cold , soulless , misogynistic motion picture . there isn't anything to like about the thinly-drawn , stereotyped characters , and the situations they drift through are far from engrossing . showgirls has one aim only : to suck in money . artistic integrity , intelligent scripting , heart-felt acting , and sincere film making are all absent . everything--from the overall plot to individual lines of dialogue--is predictable and poorly-written . as bad as the first ninety minutes of this film are , the last thirty are worse . the closing quarter of showgirls is distasteful in every way--from its gratuitous violence to its illogical plotting . the final scenes are intended to teach something about ethics , but that's a hypocritical stance for a motion picture without a moral compass . this year's other picture about lap dancing , atom egoyan's exotica , was everything showgirls is not : sensitive , intelligent , erotic , and well-acted . it's almost a disservice to the fine canadian film to mention it in the same review as the verhoeven/eszterhas monstrosity , but certain superficial similarities are too obvious to ignore . but , where exotica was full of mystery and emotion , showgirls is a hollow shell--false , mechanical , and entirely despicable in intent and execution .",JBe
"kitano , the director and star of this gangster actioner , has created a visually stunning , original and spellbinding depiction of stylized gang fights , ambushes , and assorted mayhem . kitano the actor , keeps an impassive facial expression throughout the movie , as he toys with his guns at play and for real , in a performance that wavers between a sensibility and an insensibility toward life , as violence though not glorified , nevertheless is what is fascinatingly portrayed by his unwillingness , in the end , to be perceived any other way . the great images on screen is the star of this film , not the acting , nor the story line , both pale next to the splendid visualizations kitano creates . the japanese audiences rebuked him for his critique of their social conformity ; and , thusly , his movie appeal is mostly with foreign audiences . here the film gets playful and unpredictable , as kitano has his men shed their tough guy personas and play like the children they really are . the narrative fades in importance , and the sheer poetry of the moment is caught on screen , giving us the impression that this is the first time in a long while he is enjoying being who he is . you can blindly fall in love with a film like this for its originality and forcefulness , as it allows you to look at brutality without having to offer the usual rational responses for its place in the film . the last reel of the film is somewhat of a meditation on death and suicide . it brings up all kinds of hidden emotions in kitano , and is miles apart from any other type of film of this particular genre . by taking the time needed to explore the inner workings of his character , kitano has taken the gangster role and made it more intellectually spicy than it usually is for such violent films . and , even though , there is shown a lot of the usual reactions gangsters have when they are double-crossed , such as revenge , the film somehow is trying to say more than that , but what that is , is hard to say , because it is the visual effects that are what splendidly override everything else about this film , as there are moments of gore interrupted by welcomed moments of dreamlike serenity , all done with magical camera work , probably , hiding the fact , that the film had nothing really to say other than the pretty picture it paints on screen , since whenever it had a chance to say something , kitano was mute . but it was done so stylishly well , that it was , indeed , intriguing to behold , leaving the viewer with much doubt about who kitano really is supposed to be , aside from his hubris as a gangster , and , his mixed outbursts of violent outward behavior and contemplative inner mood swings .",DSc

"screenplay : kevin williamson . director : robert rodriguez . there's something very strange going on at ohio's herrington high in the faculty . a world-shaking case of deja vu . deconstructionist screen scribe kevin williamson managed a tightrope act across the fine line between homage and outright theft in scream and scream 2 . in the faculty , he stomps that fine line into a fine paste . it's a monster movie that could not exist without the existence of other -- and much better -- movies . of course , some will argue that such is entirely the point of any williamson project , that he shows off the conventions of genre films so he can revitalize them . the problem is that there is nothing remotely revitalizing about the faculty . sure , it's a movie movie , but its quotes are as witlessly regurgitated as in any number of recent leslie nielsen projects . instead of having something clever to say about cliches , it simply recycles them , tossing in the occasional reference to "" the puppet masters "" or alien's ripley as though it suddenly makes all the trite characterizations and profanely insult-filled dialogue tolerable . even elijah wood's wide-eyed genuineness and some pseudo-analysis of teenage desire for conformity can't rescue the faculty from feeling exactly like the "" attractive teens in jeopardy "" tales it supposedly derides . if the faculty proves anything , it's how much williamson needs wes craven . both scream films featured chilling sequences which could stand with the best the genre had to offer ; they showed what chould be great about horror films even as they showed what could be awful about them . robert rodriguez -- who , if nothing else , has always shown that he has an electrifying sense of cinematic pacing -- seemingly has no idea what to do with this material . the faculty drifts sluggishly from character to character as though they actually mattered , and the few action sequences are designed to show off alien effects . every opportunity for genuine creativity is turned into yet another self-satisfied commentary on how every science-fiction story is really a rip-off of some other science-fiction story . there are a couple of amusing moments in the faculty -- a football game in which the herrington team "" infects "" the opposition during dogpile tackles , for instance -- but even most of those are taken from other films . williamson's name is supposed to make this a knowing satire of alien takeover films like invasion of the body snatchers , but there was more inventive humor in a piece of cheese like 1985's killer yogurt film the stuff . the faculty merely adds to the list of lame science fiction films for someone else to satirize . . . and maybe even get it right next time . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line "" subscribe "" .",SRe
"it doesn't have to be peeping through a bedroom window or watching a couple making love through a telescope . the seductive power of voyeurism is the knowledge that you're watching something real--not acted or scripted--and the players in the drama have no idea they're under scrutiny . it's addictive , and those hooked on it can become more involved in living the lives of others than their own . while the book is not a psychological or artistic milestone , it makes for compulsive page-turning . the story is entertaining and focused ( until the end ) , and the characters seem real . in the decisions made to turn the novel into a movie , all of that was lost . in the movie , voyeurism is a plot device in a script that goes nowhere and whose effete and implausible resolution leaves 50% of the audience's questions unanswered . if we really cared about the movie or its poorly developed characters , this might be a blow , but sliver is so badly put together that its abrupt conclusion is likely to provoke little response . personally , i don't have a problem with a movie changing the story of the book from which it has been adapted , as long as the changes are sensible and effective . the strengths of the original story are muted and the weaknesses magnified . the ending is nowhere to be found , and what appears in the movie is so disjointed and contradictory that it leaves the viewer feeling cold and cheated . because of writer eszterhas and actress stone , comparisons with basic instinct are unavoidable . actually , any similarities are superficial . there's a lot of nudity ( but no icepicks ) and a few deaths but , aside from eszterhas' often-embarrassing dialogue , the two films aren't that close . as if it isn't bad enough that the script needs a major re-write , this lackluster production suffers from other problems . sharon stone , who was effective as the femme fatale of basic instinct , shows a lack of aptitude in playing the woman-in-distress . her emotional range in sliver is limited and she fails to generate much sympathy . william baldwin's portrayal is too bland for a character with the depth of passion and emotion that zeke is supposed to have . tom berenger puts a great deal of energy into what is essentially a thankless role ( his character isn't in the book ) , but little that we see or learn about jack landsford makes much sense . the gem in the rough of sliver is polly walker ( the spoiled heiress of enchanted april , who phillip noyce also directed in patriot games ) , although she's on-screen for too few scenes . production-wise , sliver has the look and feel of something from mtv . the incidental music is intrusive and the quick-cuts are distracting . with the movie's focus on video , it's odd that the visuals are so pedestrian . there is also a sense of heavy editing . at least one scene referred to explicitly has been cut out . with thrillers , it's difficult to say who will like what . certainly , those who are looking for a good whodunnit won't find it in sliver . equally displeased with this film will be the moviegoer looking for a fast-paced film . even those who loved basic instinct may be disappointed--sliver has little of the tension and relentless energy that marked verhoeven's 1992 movie . all-in-all , there's little here to please anyone , and those who loved levin's book are bound to leave the theater disgusted .",JBe
"without exception , the indian in the cupboard is the best family film to come along thus far in 1995 , topping such notables as pocahontas and the little princess . based on the popular book by lynne reid banks and scripted by et writer melissa mathison , the movie teaches lessons without preaching , and focuses on the magic of relationships rather than that of special effects . this leads to a production as affecting for adults as for children . omri , played with charm and enthusiasm by hal scardino , is an average nine-year old with a very unusual cupboard in his room . the visual effects that mix four-foot actors with their miniature companions are effective , but not ostentatious , and the lack of flash keeps the focus on the characters and their story . suspension of disbelief in the indian in the cupboard is surprisingly easy . this film is about friendships , responsibility , and ethics . the bond between omri and little bear illustrates that , regardless of size , shape , or race , any friendship is a rare and special thing . thirteen years ago , et taught the same lesson to that summer's movie audiences . frank oz , a director who always seeks original and challenging projects ( one of his past successes was little shop of horrors ) , brings an uplifting sense of fun to this film . the indian in the cupboard moves along at a nearly-perfect pace : slowly enough to capture the nuances of the characters' relationships , but quickly enough to avoid stagnation . it deserves a better fate than that normally reserved for similar fare because , ultimately , this movie is not only about magic -- it is magical .",JBe
"great premise , terrible execution . how many times have i written that line this year ? in the case of the long kiss goodnight , it's especially frustrating , though , because the basic idea is so intriguing -- the perfect background for a top- notch noir thriller . unfortunately , director renny harlin ( die hard 2 , cliffhanger ) wasn't at all interested in making a tightly-paced , character-driven movie . what we get instead is exactly what we've come to expect from him -- lots of gunshots , explosions , and general mayhem . when the smoke finally clears for the final credits , we may have had a tolerably good time , but there's no lingering satisfaction . the premise involves that age-old plot staple of soap operas : amnesia . but lacking a personal history doesn't really bother her because her present is so pleasant . maybe i was expecting a little too much from an action film , but the hitchcockian ideas are so juicy that they deserve deeper exploration . the action , unfortunately , is distressingly routine . alas , these are nothing more than visual candy . missing is the freshness that marked that action sequences in harlin's directorial debut , die hard 2 . davis is a good enough actress to carry off the dual identity , although charly seems a lot like a humorless cross between la femme nikita and a female james bond . sam is more appealing , which is obviously the intention . at least the end is about reconciling these disparate identities . jackson is magnificent , and i'm going to recommend the film largely on the basis of his turn as mitch . i wasn't wild about a long kiss goodnight as a whole , but this is the kind of delightful performance that deserves to be seen . jackson adds more than a dash of humor to the action mix , throwing out one-liners guaranteed to send audiences into paroxysms of laughter ( his line about people trying to get out of new jersey brought down the house , but that may have something to do with where i saw the movie ) . whenever jackson was on screen , i forgot about the film's shortcomings and appreciated what he was doing with mitch . ultimately , i suppose an individual's enjoyment of a long kiss goodnight will be greatly affected by expectations . if you're searching for a slick-looking , mindless , bond-derived action film with a buff female hero , this should fit the bill nicely . but if the premise leads you to expect something a little more interesting -- possibly even a change of pace for harlin -- a long kiss goodnight will disappoint . regardless of your viewpoint , however , keep your eyes on jackson , and you'll understand how i can generate some enthusiasm for this otherwise uneven , overblown explosions extravaganza . -- ingmar bergman",JBe
"everyone [in vietnam] knew the gestures associated with the preparation of the papaya and , since the houses weren't soundproofed , you often heard it being prepared in the house next door . you knew the sound because the papaya is hollow and when you hit it ( with a knife ) , it makes a very characteristic noise . relying more on tone and feel , the scent of green papaya manages to engross an audience because of its scrupulous attention to detail and its ability to effectively capture the essence of life's subtle , individual moments . to say that the scent of green papaya has no plot would be to grossly misrepresent it . the movie is divided into two sections . midway through the film , the time frame shifts ahead a decade . the scent of green papaya succeeds because writer/director tran anh hung has an almost-perfect sense of what is necessary to make a simple story work . there are no grand revelations or surprising plot twists , but the film is compelling nevertheless , precisely because of its sense of reality . what other recent film has made the act of giving a cooking lesson such a potentially-intriguing activity ? the effectiveness of the scent of green papaya is surprising considering its visual limits . filmed on france sound stages rather than on-location in vietnam , there is none of the expected lush vegetation one has come to expect from a film set in this country . even the papaya trees are dead husks with real fruit and leaves glued to them ( although it's not possible to tell this from watching the movie ) . on the other hand , the use of sound effects is excellent , from the chirping of a cricket to the roar of a plane overhead . in a film with so little dialogue ( there is a space of thirty minutes where only several lines are uttered ) , music and sound effects become critical contributors . the acting is adequate--no more and no less , but because the scent of green papaya focuses more on moments than characters , this isn't a serious detriment . lu man san , as mui at ten years old , is cute and impish , with a commendable variety of facial expressions . her successor , tran nu yen-khe ( the director's real-life fiancee ) isn't as impressive . she smiles too much and possesses an almost-sinuously graceful body language that seems inappropriate to the circumstances . what the scent of green papaya does so well is to show the everyday life of a culture that has been bombed into history . this is the kind of motion picture that could easily become tedious and boring , because so little happens . to manage what tran anh hung has by telling his story and holding the interest of the audience , deserves notice and credit . the scent of green papaya is an enjoyable experience made all the more enchanting by its simplicity .",JBe

"when one thinks of scandinavian movies , the name of ingmar bergman leaps to mind . the great swedish director's films were almost always austere , beautifully-made , and intellectual ( sometimes to a fault ) . as a result , those whose expectations for junk mail are based on bergman , are in for something of a shock . this movie , the product of norwegian first-time director pal sletaune , owes more to david lynch and denmark's the kingdom than it does to the work of bergman , troell , or any other notable scandinavian film maker . most of the film takes place in the seed , dirty , and dreary backrooms and alleys of oslo , and the characters are like rejects from terry gilliam's brazil . and , although junk mail threads its way through a series of potentially-serious issues , sletaune keeps the tone comical ( albeit darkly so ) . in many ways , this is a strange movie ; i liked it in spite of the characters , who could charitably be called unpleasant losers , and in spite of the grungy atmosphere , which seems to have soaked into the bones of everyone populating the picture . junk mail generated an incredibly strong buzz at last year's toronto film festival ( where i had originally planned to see it ) . instead of faithfully delivering parcels and envelopes to their rightful destinations ( see kevin costner's the postman if you want this kind of mentality ) , he dumps about half of his load so he can spend hours loafing . not surprisingly , the standout performance in junk mail belongs to robert skjaerstad , who manages to make a worm like roy seem believable . >from time-to-time , we actually find ourselves feeling something close to sympathy for him . andrine saether is pleasant as line . per egil aske plays georg as a cross between a conscienceless sociopath and a bumbling idiot . he's deadly , but a little too stupid to be truly frightening . this edgy , entirely original movie succeeds for a couple of reasons : it isn't afraid of breaking the rules ( the lead character is a pathetic loser who never finds redemption ) and it never overexplains itself to the audience . it's a fresh , quirky picture that will appeal to anyone looking for something that , as monty python put it , is completely different . the only real downside is that the conclusion is a little too open-ended to be fully satisfying . up to that point , however , junk mail is an entertainingly offbeat experience . it's unclear whether this will get any kind of widespread u . s . distribution , but it has already become , and will likely continue to be , a film festival favorite .

"" listen , if this isn't art , i don't know what is , "" joey yells to his field of fornicators , ready to do the pregame show before the big deflowerment . actually , given its premise , the movie is remarkably tame with little sex or nudity . mainly the actors just talk about sex , and , even then , the language is milder than you would expect . american pie , for example , is much raunchier than american virgin . american virgin is the sort of film that most viewers will either find ridiculously awful or outrageously funny . my reaction proved , however , to be neither of these extremes . although i admired the director's audacious approach and was charmed by suvari's performance in a badly underwritten role , i found that too many of the jokes came across flat . the result is a picture that's better than might be expected but not quite good enough to recommend . it is rated r for sexual content , nudity and language and would be acceptable for most teenagers .",SRh
"there will be no happy hollywood type of ending here . the film was mildly diverting , suffering from a weak storyline and trevor howard as the lead actor . he is too regal an actor to play a noir protagonist . what was gritty about the film , was the quick-cut editing , the magnificent black and white photography , and the keen direction . the film had a certain amount of distress coming forth from it characters and lots of brutal scenes , adding much suspense to the routine story . but the british films are no match to the americans when it comes to noir , this one being no exception .",DSc
"viewing brother of sleep is the cinematic equivalent of watching a train wreck . it's definitely not a pleasant experience , but there's such a concentration of intense tragedy and drama that it's impossible to look away . brother of sleep is wrenching , depressing , and often unpleasant , and there are plenty of narrative flaws , but the overall experience lies within the scope of what one expects from a well-made motion picture . director joseph vilsmaier , who made the memorable epic stalingrad , has chosen to adapt robert schneider's novel in an artistic manner that borders on excessive . despite its stern stance against organized religion ( the hypocrisy of which gets skewered at every opportunity ) , the film endorses spirituality , and , as a result , there's a strange , almost- mystical quality to the tone . even though the music itself isn't that convincing , the raw passion is , making this one of those transcendent scenes that justifies a trip to theater for brother of sleep . while the romance works , it's not as involving as it could be . the distance between the audience and the characters keeps us from caring deeply about how things are resolved . there are times when we can feel the lonely gulf separating elsbeth and elias , but that's not always the case . unlike jude , which plunges us into the heart of a doomed love affair and keeps us there , brother of sleep's stylistic flourishes don't foster the kind of intimacy necessary to fashion an equally wrenching storyline . it always seems to be raining or snowing , and the ground is a like a sea of mud and slush . this isn't a film for those who want their movie characters to be neat and presentable . elsbeth is easily the most sympathetic person in the movie , even after she's largely out of the action . andre eisermann plays elias as slightly detached and distracted -- someone who lives on a different plane than everyone around him . there are times when brother of sleep's narrative is choppy , but this does little to blunt the impact of the key themes . and , although vilsmaier's surreal style may detract as much from the film as it adds , much of the most provocative material comes through unscathed , including the central metaphysical conflict between the demands of genius and the desires of the body . brother of sleep isn't the kind of movie to seek as a cure for depression , but , for those looking for a downbeat excursion into artistic storytelling , this film offers a solid example .",JBe
"squat little extraterrestrial with a telescoping neck . well , actually , it's a golden retriever named buddy . from the trailers and promotions for air bud , you might be expecting a rambunctious sports comedy about a bad-team-made-good in the recent disney tradition , with a hoops-playing pooch leading a basketball team to victory -- sort of the mighty dogs . with a few token exceptions , it's nothing of the kind . screenwriters paul tamasy and aaron mendelsohn want air bud to be a touching story of a lonely boy and his dog , something warm but slow-paced , something decidedly _not_ the mighty dogs . given the formulaic drivel disney usually passes off as live action entertainment , that noble goal alone should have made air bud worth supporting . young kevin zegers is a decent enough actor , but he's fighting against some tough precedents when he tries to make his friendship with buddy uniquely compelling , as well as fighting against charles martin smith's languid direction . the second mistake is purely the fault of disney's marketing department , which will be luring unsuspecting kids and their parents to what they believe is going to be a slapstick comedy . buddy's impressive basketball tricks might make a nice five-minute visit with letterman or leno , but they're not the stuff a feature film is made of . with the exception of one minor chase scene and the big basketball game finale ( which features the ridiculous fiction -- and anyone who has ever been to a middle school basketball game will realize this -- of a middle school basketball game with a score in the 80s and a team which runs a pivot game reminiscent of medowlark lemon-era globetrotters ) , air bud is achingly slow . twice as many children in the screening audience were roaming the aisles as were enraptured by the less-than-antic antics of josh and buddy . it's tough to knock a family film which dares to avoid bodily function humor , but air bud simply has no focus or direction , a fact made abundantly clear when the ridiculous basketball game finale gives way to an even more ridiculous courtroom finale . air bud is really deserving of praise for only one reason : it's not what it's being sold as . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line "" subscribe "" .",SRe
"there have been very few films about the american revolution and most of them have been terrible , with the exception of d . w . at least , they kept it moving at a brisk pace , but , unfortunately , they used a good deal of violence . there were a multitude of choreographed battle scenes , face-to-face combat scenes , and sweeping panoramic shots of the beautiful countryside , which should take your mind off all the empty messages of the film . the filmmaker even made slavery appear as not such a bad thing by having the slaves seem more like workers than slaves , they just seemed to be having themselves a good old time on the plantation . when the 158-minutes are up , you might not have much of an historical perspective of the war , but you should feel good that the arch villain got his just desserts . the colonel's villain role is about as one-dimensional and predictable as it gets for such a villain , whereby he becomes more cartoonish and less menacing as the story rolls on . and there you have the plot , which is not much on history and not much on character development . everything is so predictable about this glossy photographed film , everything is so banal , everything seems so dishonest , and the dialogue is so disparaging , that i found this to be such a morbid attempt at history , such a futile way to tell a story . everything from the acting and the script was flat . everyone was reduced to a cardboard figure , and the war seemed to be a manufactured one , as if this film was made as a tv episode . the story lacked vitality , only scoring points for its fine costumes and john williams musical score . the film always seemed to be an unhealthy mixture of mawkishness and carnality , offering nothing but shallow responses for all its preaching about freedom . only this film comes with some bogus history lesson thrown in , which makes it more shamefully exploitive , a "" payback "" with the redcoats as the gangsters . i had an ugly feeling when i left the theater , like someone was trying awfully hard to sell me on patriotism : using children , the flag , a horrid villain , all to shamelessly stir me up , instead of telling me a story about a credible character who got involved in the war for independence .",DSc

"until we rented it over the holidays , i had not seen it in its entirety in a couple of decades . this part of the movie has a capraesque quality . too often child actors are no more than cute , sometimes painfully so . all three of these kids give skillful performances of real depth . it seems boo is the local bogeyman , or so all the kids believe . boo lives in a house that reminds you of the house in psycho . even if it does not look at all similar , it feels much the same . only brave kids , like tomboy scout , dare get near the porch , much less on it . do you remember who plays boo ? it is robert duvall in his first movie part . he does not speak a word and is not even seen until the end , but his role in the film is crucial . elmer bernstein's music for the film remind us of the magic and the simplicity of that time . the crickets outside will almost lull you to sleep , but knowing that danger or tragedy is just around the corner , you dare not blink an eye . there were tire swings in the front yard , and front porches with rocking chairs or swings were de rigueur . the kids in this picture have more in common with those of tom sawyer's era than today's . in a film bursting at the seams with great performances , brock peters's small role is acted with brilliance . the acting by paxton and anderson is chillingly effective as well . their performances are strong and believable without the natural tendency to overact their parts as villains . it is done with devastating force , but without the theatrics we have become to associate with trials . the secondary event happens near the end , but i can not describe it without giving it away so i will say no more . second only to the quality of the acting is the precise and lucid direction by robert mulligan and the literate and academy award winning script by horton foote , based on the book by harper lee . the entire show is a masterpiece crafted with loving care . a show that must be seen . and seen again . it is not rated , but would probably be pg-13 . there is no sex , nudity , or profanity . there are mature themes and some frightening scenes of people being chased and grabbed . the movie would probably be appropriate for kids nine or ten and up . i know it would have frightened the daylights out of my seven and a half year old had we let him watch it . i recommend the movie to you in the strongest possible terms , and i award the film a  .",SRh
"director : richard donner . one might expect from that list that maverick is a good-looking , good- sounding , good-natured production , and it is . and little more . maverick is pleasant , but it never really takes off , opting to replace a solid narrative with a series of sketches of widely varying quality . gibson plays bret maverick , a roguish gambler much better at playing cards than he is at playing hero . some of these moments are quite entertaining , particularly an encounter with a group of indians with whom maverick enjoys a special rapport . gibson and foster are also quite good together , generating a lot of smiles simply from the spark of their interaction . gibson in particular is perfectly cast as maverick , a sly but ultimately big- hearted fellow with a gift for avoiding danger . there is enough charm and energy in his performance to carry maverick over many of its rough spots . it's a shame that maverick misfires nearly as often as it hits . it's a peculiar mixture of missed opportunities , overkill and necessary but unfortunate editing decisions ( which whittled this once two and a half hour film to a still over-long 2 : 05 ) . when he produces a $100 bill and asks for change , you expect a slick con , but again maverick doesn't quite follow through . once the actor is unmasked , the joke should be over , but it's milked for more than it's worth in a way that made me think , "" all right , i get the joke .

"this is werner herzog's first feature and is easily his most conventional story to date ; which , nevertheless , results in a rather interesting drama even if it is a somewhat heavy handed metaphoric one when it relates the mental breakdown of stroszek to the irrationality of war . there is nothing for the soldiers to do on this barren island , with its torrid greek sun bearing down on them , which makes their stay here seem like an imprisonment . but he is going off on lethargic mood swings , where he can't function for long periods at a time . but the soldiers don't buy into his story , even though his life story is probably more real than theirs . when a piano player plays chopin and tells them how chopin was really mean in his music contrary to the way most interpret his work , we see for ourselves how this music seems to have a dizzying affect on stroszek , who is beginning to show some serious signs of cracking . herzog's characters exhibited many bizarre touches that made them full of life , certainly different from any american film about nazi soldiers . these soldiers seemed like flawed human beings , trapped by the environment they were in and their own idiosyncratic nature , all of which made this ordinary film seem rather special and well-worth taking note of .",DSc

"screenplay : abby kohn & marc silverstein . director : raja gosnell . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( adult themes , profanity , drug use ) running time : 104 minutes . i'm willing to forgive never been kissed many of its failings because , for all practical purposes , it's a fantasy . i can over look the irony of a film about an adult returning to interact with teenagers which portray teens the same inane way adults usually think of them . i can let it slide that the tone is terminally bubbly when a touch of venom might have helped . i can even shrug my shoulders at the notion that drew barrymore was ever a spat-upon teen wretch . sometimes a romantic comedy can get away with being ridiculous as it strives to pull us into its wish fulfillment . what it can't get away with is being lazy or being miscast , the two blunders that insure never been kissed never had a chance . if only the script had shown as much dilligence with the other elements . arquette's character is potentially even more interesting than barrymore's -- a jock who peaked at 18 trying to re-live his glory days -- but it's generally watered-down and ignored . -- and builds to a spectacularly clumsy conclusion . most depressing of all is a ghastly device which finds josie wearing a miniature camera , contributing nothing more to the story than pointless cutaways to josie's co-workers gaping or cringing in embarrassment . there's plenty to gape and cringe at as barrymore plays josie . even the marketing people at fox realize that she's most appealing as a sweet object of desire , making the central image in the film's publicity a photo of barrymore smiling coquettishly with knee drawn up to her chest . it's slightly embarrassing watching her play the professional josie as a tightly-coiffed fussbudget correcting everyone's grammar and usage ; as implausible as she may be as a high school senior , she proves even more implausible as a grown-up . you always want to like a film as good-natured as never been kissed , even though it wants so much to be liked . there simply isn't a nuance to the material that director raja gosnell manages to capture , not a moment of sincere emotion , nothing that doesn't look like it wouldn't exist if not for other movies about kids in high school . when the script manages to work in a wise observation -- like the idea that one popular person in high school can dictate who's cool and who's not -- it feels like someone tripped over it accidentally . never been kissed is most certainly a fantasy for anyone who ever felt like the quintessential high school outsider , but the film-makers are living in a fantasy world if they think that's all they need to deliver . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .",SRe
"it has been a long time since a film inspired as profound a case of "" what am i missing ? "" in me as shine . this australian drama has been a fixture on year-end top ten lists , won a best picture nod from the national board of review , and picked up a new york film critics association best actor for star geoffrey rush . so i sat myself down to watch shine , and i waited to be transported . and i waited . and i waited . and it never happened . shine is an extremely well-crafted film , but it doesn't pay off at a gut level . director scott hicks' restrained approach to an uplifting story ends up choking much of the life out of it . perhaps the film's best sequence involves david's performance of the "" rach 3 "" at the albert hall , wild hair and sweat flying in slow motion as his ultimate artistic triumph becomes a mute pounding of keys . even the death of one character cannot evoke much emotional response , and david's match with gillian is apparently the result of complementary astrological charts instead of a genuine connection between them . shine may be about david helfgott , but peter helfgott is the real soul of the film , and when he disappears from the narrative there is nothing to drive it forward . geoffrey rush's performance as the adult david is superb , a portrait of mental illness which is vivid and lacking the obtrusive kookiness of many screen depictions of such conditions ; his mile-a-minute monologues full of puns and streams of consciousness display a brilliant mind imploding upon itself . there simply isn't much to the second half of shine which leads us to a conclusion . hicks' background is in documentary film-making , and it seems that his instinct is to let david's story tell itself . most films about characters struggling to triumph over adversity play to the broadest possible emotional canvas , and it is admirable that hicks has chosen not to bludgeon his audience insensible with feel-good signifiers . shine is a good-looking , good-sounding and thoroughly professional production with a pair of excellent performances by armin mueller-stahl and geoffrey rush . it is also too sedate by half , a story of shattered genius which opts for a dim glow when it needs a dazzling shine .",SRe
"there's one fundamental question that has to be asked about films like bad company : is the script one step ahead of the audience , or is it the other way around ? in large part , the answer determines whether suspense mysteries are pulse-pounding or pedantic . in this case , it's something of a mixed bag . for , while director damian harris shows aptitude with a kind of picture that's oh-so-easy to mess up , his film occasionally moves too slowly to sustain tension . there are times when guessing what's around the corner becomes secondary to how long it actually takes to make the turn . with one foot in the noir camp and the other in the modern-day world of covert operations , bad company builds its cleverly-layered plot around two central characters . although lacking the full atmospheric richness of , say , a red rock west , the film nevertheless possesses a stylish appeal . nasty characters always make for delicious viewing , especially when they attempt to outplot each other . despite its share of delectable moments , bad company is far from the perfect double-cross thriller . borrowing heavily from dozens of previous entries , this movie stirs the mix to arrive at something that alternates between playfully fresh and poorly-paced . bad company frequently sacrifices character development for plot twists , but that's arguably the right choice--force of personality , as embodied by fishburne and barkin , is often sufficient . certainly , film noir doesn't appeal to everyone , but for those that enjoy this sort of darkly convoluted plot , bad company isn't as unpleasant as its title might suggest .",JBe

"since the film didn't have a director , the film's star , charlton heston , suggested to the people at universal that they get orson to direct it ( this is heston's version ) . it was magnificently photographed by emphasizing the contrasts between dark and light shades as filmed by the great cinematographer russell metty , which abetted the imaginative tale , whose main story is about the downfall of the sleazy , obese lawman played with sheer brilliance by orson . it's a b-film more powerful and hard-boiled than the weak-minded upper-studio heads at universal could handle . the video that came out in the '70s was an interpretation of the three re-edited versions , which was far removed from the way orson wanted it seen . the film ended up as a box office disappointment , giving ammo to those in hollywood who said that he could only make an art film and not a commercial one . orson refused to recognize the version that universal sent to the movie theaters as his film , in fact he called it an 'odious thing . ' never fully receiving the recognition that the film should have gotten for the masterpiece it was , it was even considered by some film critics to be a disappointing welles film , not comparable to his masterpiece of "" citizen kane . "" the film , nevertheless , got recognized abroad , especially by the french new wave directors and eventually the film was starting to get a following among young intellectuals in this country and started to get its just recognition for the poetically visionary and original film it was . it was a film that did things films never did before , both technically and as a hard-hitting baroque thriller . it was the first film to have natural dialogue in a moving car . it is arguably the greatest opening shot in film history because of its visual impact in setting up the feature's characters and the tenseness of the story that was to follow . orson used a hand-held camera and specialized not only in wide-angle shots but by his constant intercutting , he was able to keep the action flowing and the story suspenseful . the film had been restored somewhat by 1978 for its video distribution and it picked up some running time from how it was first shown at 96 minutes and now it was back to its original time of 108 minutes . in the 1990s the film was finally pieced together from the memo orson sent the studio and the hack director's scenes were cut , and it picked up an additional three minutes . the effort to restore the film to the way orson originally shot it , allowed the story to become clearer and for the film to have the shape the artist wanted it to have . this is about the closest we could get to the way orson filmed it , since he passed away in 1985 and we have no other idea about what else he may have wanted to do with the film . spoiler : for those who don't want to follow the rest of the story , please stop reading at this point and resume reading the last paragraph , which makes some further points about the film . the subtle beauty of this scene , is in the restored version , where it looks as if the machine killed him . fans of the cinema should be pleased with this restored work and after seeing it will have a chance to judge for themselves which version is the masterpiece . there should be no doubt about what that choice should be . for cinefiles , thanks must go out to those who put in such a worthwhile effort to get this restoration accomplished .",DSc
"although based on a true story , as the movie reminds us , the preachy and overlong film stretches credulity at every turn . as directed by tom shadyac and written by steve oedekerk , who worked together on the recent remake of the nutty professor , the movie should come complete with two warnings . first , the fda should serve notice to the audience . although the agency knows that the ingestion of large quantities of artificial sweeteners can kill lab rats , the effect on audiences of such a sickeningly sweet script have not been tested . second , parents should be on notice that the film , quite unlike its happy trailers , is full of death and dying . the realism is more than one might expect from the film's marketing and its pg-13 rating . jokes about masturbation and gynecologist's stirrups are just a few of the movie's questionable inclusions that may surprise parents expecting lighter fare . the syrupy script feeds him lines that sound more like readings than conversations . the nefarious dean gets the worst of the cliched lines . the movie , heavy on messages , has as a basic theme that it isn't the drugs and the operations that will save your life . what you need is a feel-good doctor . and if he doesn't cure you , at least you'll die a little bit happier . these bald , cancer-stricken kids are genuine and cute , the only such characters in the story . the movie lets robin cut up for no reason other than getting some cheap laughs . to the cheering audience of conventioneers . what -- you may ask -- is this scene doing in this movie ? movies like patch adams need aids to help you through it . when you have trouble falling asleep , you count sheep . it almost seems that he manages to wear more shirts than there are scenes in the movie . there may be other survival tricks , but , hopefully , this one will suffice . patch adams runs too long at 1 : 55 . it is rated pg-13 for frightening scenes of death and dying , profanity and crude humor and would be acceptable for kids over 12 . my son jeffrey , age 9 , was bored and upset by the film , giving it only  ? . he liked some of the humor such as the invisible squirrels' scene . he didn't like the "" bad words "" and complained that the movie was way too sad . his friend alan , age 9 , liked the way the film was "" funny and disgusting "" but thought it was too sad . he generously gave it  .",SRh
"tie me down ! ) never does anything in a conventional manner , and kika is no exception . a black farce on sex , violence , and the attraction held by both for the general public , kika is one of those films that causes the mpaa to get nervous . as a result , this admittedly explicit motion picture was given an nc-17 . the real problem with kika is that , while it's moderately entertaining and occasionally riotously funny , one of the first thoughts after leaving the theater is likely to be along the lines of "" what was the point of that ? "" as a satirical social commentary , the film is surprisingly shallow , not to mention insensitive . it's easy to see how some viewers could be offended by the cavalier , jokey manner in which rape and incest are portrayed . the plum role belongs to victoria abril , portraying a "" journalist "" who makes geraldo rivera look like a serious tv newsman . with a camera mounted atop some sort of futuristic-looking headgear , she goes from crime scene to crime scene , hoping to catch a murder or something equally as juicy . this satire on tabloid tv and the public's fascination with it is done with scalding insight and an indifference to political correctness . almodovar has never worried about being accused of going too far , and the viewer's reaction to kika may reflect how much distance along this path they're willing to go with the writer/director . the title character is a bit flighty , and more than a little afraid of a commitment . for the first two-thirds of the movie , kika lies at the center of everything that's going on . removing the main character from the climax is a strange way to structure a movie . kika is too long , and the ending doesn't fit well with the much-better first half . by trying to tie all the disparate themes and storylines together at the end , almodovar creates a chaotic mess that is never successfully untangled . there are a number of dead bodies , but no real sense of closure . there's no doubt that kika does exactly what almodovar intended it to . from its moments of inspired comedy to its descent into bad taste , the director's indelible signature is woven into the fabric of the film . this movie is likely to offend as many as it appeals to , and i felt a little of the pull in both directions . ultimately , however , almodovar's central parody is strong enough to save this film from floundering too much or too often . it's daring and nasty , but rarely brilliant .",JBe
"you see , this mr . perfect turns out to be a madman . he exhibits signs of being a control freak , someone who might even be a nut case , by taking everything so literal and acting in a robotic and deliberate fashion when he speaks , so that everything he does seems out of place . in fact , the acting in the film by everyone is really fine , especially considering how thin the script was . it is the story itself and the way it is directed that leads to the detriment of the film , allowing it to have the look of one of those films made only to be seen as a rental video , which indeed is how this film was released . the film tries to play like noir , but only ends up being the kind of fake noir that is more irritating than complimentary . it tries to be purposefully evasive about its storyline and to have its tenuous story be based on chance as being the sole determinant of life . what it eventually becomes is a predictable psycho flick and not an unpredictable noir film , as it wanted to be . it has trapped itself into being a film without a plot , with rotten dialogue , and a fake means of maintaining tension . it tries so hard to give itself a weird angle through its characterizations , which only work on a superficial level-from the neurotic damsel-in-peril , plummer- to the split personality performance of forster , whose actions waiver between maniacally calm reasoning to histrionic schmaltz , as he goes off the deep end reciting rhymes . the main problem , which the film is never able to overcome , is that the storyline is not that compelling and that the characters are not necessarily interesting even if they are quirky . the story never had a real strength to it ; it always seemed like the actors were play-acting , that the script was struggling to device another gimmick to go with the coin toss motif , instead of letting the story seem to come about out of its own accord . this did not help explore anything going on inside the characters , only trivializing the story further , making it rely solely on a gimmick to tell its story . what we are left with is a series of encounters among characters who are not that appealing in the first place , and also by the end of the film , we know only a little more about the psychopath than we did from the opening scene . i therefore wasn't sure what the director wanted to accomplish , except he probably thought by showing how idiosyncratic all the characters could be , that would be enough to get it over . if that was what he was thinking , he misjudged the quality of the film , but not before he showed flashes of talent here and there , for example , in the opening scene in the desert --- forster's calm demeanor was played-off beautifully against plummer's nervous energy , and with the desert lurking as a hostile backdrop to the action , it added a thrilling surreal sense of dramatics to the story . but the film fell too quickly into the serial-killer mode , and lost the edge it never had but always wanted .",DSc

"pulp fiction is a singular show . the best way to describe it is that it is as if you sit down in the movie theater and are immediately transported to a roller coaster going full speed through a fun house of ghoulish images . this is complemented with one of the funniest , smartest , and filthiest dialogs i have heard in a long time . there is no other movie i can compare it to . it has the adrenaline flow of speed , the intelligent dialog of my dinner with andre , the violence of the goriest part of the godfather , and the comedy of tootsie . all that having been said , it is like none of the above other than the superficial aspects i just mentioned . if extreme violence ( e . g . , brains blown on car windows ) is something you can not endure , if 700 uses of the f word is something you can not tolerate , if heavy drug use is something you care never to see ( cocaine is passe we learn , all of the in-gangsters now do heroin ) , then do not pay your money to see pulp fiction . on the other hand , all of the above really works in this show . this is a parody of criminal life and a really funny one . oscars are possible here . harvey keitel plays a fixer of problems for the bad guy . christopher walken shows up in a single long important scene . whew , and i probably missed a lot of other people who did some great acting . the major hero and the one who took the most risks in this movie was the scriptwriter . this is a movie that to describe it will only make you want not to go see it , yet it is mesmerizing and wonderful . the intensity level of the movie is off the scale . people were laughing like crazy in the theater and to intelligent dialog too . other scenes had the audience gasping for breath and uttering out loud "" oh , my god "" . several scenes were worse the finger cutting scene in the piano . the camerawork was mainly standard stuff , but there are several scenes where it got pretty experimental . the best example is the long scene of wills staring into the camera without moving while he listens to the major bad guy , whom we have not yet seen , delivering a long lecture . it then switches to a view of only the back of the bad guy's head with everything else out of focus while willis listens for quite a while more . if you can like roller coasters and if you have taken to heart my very serious caveats at the first , then i recommend this show to you . do not take or let any teenager see this . it is too much for them . it is rated r , but this is certainly nc-17 . why it did not get nc-17 i can not figure out unless it was because the show only talks about sex and has no naked bodies . it runs 2 : 34 which is a tad long . i think the movie is truly unique and is perfect for its genre so i give it my  . see it on a big screen with lots of folks in the audience for maximum enjoyment .",SRh
"this is raimi's attempt to go mainstream with an art film thriller that might have an appeal to an audience that likes films that give them some ideas to ponder . this wintry morality tale , its bleak snowbound midwestern atmosphere reminds me a lot of fargo , without the comedy , as it examines the character of three small town locals who have no worldly experience , but have adjusted in one way or another to their lot in life . billy bob is particularly outstanding in his true-to-life characterization of such an individual . but as a result , her interference makes things worse . this is a dilemma for the filmmakers , there seems to be something devoid about this tale that can't surface , except in outwardly visual terms , as we clearly see how morality is drawn in terms of black and white . there is the great shot of the snow in all its whiteness and the black crows surrounding the downed plane , as this sighting of where the money is seems to be a symbol for the film's morality play . the result of all the trio's bungling , is that things are no longer simple for them , as greed and their extended version of the american dream , but this time earned the too easy way , via a suitcase full of money found in the snow , becomes too much for them to handle with any sensibility , as all their character flaws become magnified , and they begin to get careless and talk too much of what they found . this is a strong gut-wrenching suspense film , one of the top ten of 1998 . but the film is just lacking something , and i think that thing it needed , was a breath of vagueness about what is morally right or wrong in order for the story to remain on an even psychological/spiritual keel and not descend into a literal biblical morality theme . raimi did a superb visual job , carefully weaving a noir tale without any heroes or apparent villains , a difficult task to do , but one that he succeeds in without question . my feeling is , that in due time , we will look back at this film and wonder how it was overlooked by so many , as it will become recognized as one of the great suspense classics .",DSc

"her unexplained theatrical job might well have been at a place called something like the pussy cat lounge , but gina is nonetheless delighted . the hot desert sun quickly fries their brains and nerves , causing them scandalously to say exactly what they are really thinking rather than the polite blather that we usually take for conversation . in the superb cast , bruce davison and janet mcteer play ray and liz , a sad , childless couple . the acerbic script by anders thomas jensen and kristian levring has characters generally going after each other with words rather than showy , emotional outbursts . it is one of the few dogme films that is actually enhanced by the technique . here the harsh lighting and the intimate , handheld camerawork blend in perfectly with the austerity of the setting . the picture , however , does have its logical and technical problems . the characters stay outside and get parched by the glaring sun when it would only make sense to perform the play indoors . and why cinematographer jens schlosser keeps framing scenes so that people's eyes , the most expressive part of one's anatomy , are chopped off remains a mystery . as their strength wanes and it looks like no one will ever come to save them , the story gets more and more intriguing . and , as their minds become focused on survival , the human drama ratchets up in intensity . the ending will not be satisfying to everyone , but this isn't the type of picture that is made to appeal to the masses . suffice it to say that it worked for me . it is rated r for sexuality and language and would be acceptable for older teenagers . just send me a letter with the word "" subscribe "" in the subject line .",SRh

"even though the picture may be criticized for being a fictionalized composite of various events , it's probably closer to the truth than many films that claim to be true stories . regardless of this , it is most certainly an exhilarating and satisfying thriller that will have you on the edge of your seat once the battles begin . the movie's only serious flaw is that director jonathan mostow ( breakdown ) , who shares the writing credits with sam montgomery and david ayer , lets his movie drift at first as he takes too long setting up the plot . but , after the movie finds its sea legs , you won't have time to catch your breath in this first action movie of the summer . ( okay , i know it's only spring , but this film , with it's realistic battle sequences , is a big budget , summer thriller even if it arrives in port a bit early . ) this simple plan goes seriously awry , setting up a wonderful , classic war sequence that takes place mainly underwater in a sub as it is being attacked . the tension is palpable , causing your adrenaline to pump like crazy . as captain dahlgren , bill paxton gives the movie's only wooden performance , arguably because of his stilted dialog . his xo is played by the film's star , matthew mcconaughey , who turns in one of his most convincing pieces of acting , eschewing his tendency to superciliousness ( amistad , for example ) . if there is one part of the movie that best captures the film's essence , it is the realistically frightening depth charge scenes . an imaginative captain can help , but basically you have to wait and pray that they will miss you . one of the few unabashedly patriotic movies in some time , u-571 pays homage to our brave soldiers who fought and died in a world at war . and it lets you vicariously feel some of their trauma as they wonder if each moment will be their last . it is rated pg-13 for war violence and would be fine for kids around 12 and up .",SRh
"director : arlene sanford . seventy-nine weeks -- count them , seventy-nine -- is all that separates the release of a very brady sequel from the brady bunch movie , in what has to rank as one of the fastest sequel turnarounds in film history . even taking into account the fact that the brady house sets and alice's uniform were already available , that's a tidy 18 months for writing the script , pre-production , shooting and post-production . you might expect a rather perfunctory piece of film-making given those circumstances , and you would find it . a very brady sequel has some cute moments , but it is lacking the sense of direction which made the brady bunch movie such a guilty pleasure . but all of them should be more concerned about roy , who primarily seems concerned about the whereabouts of a horse statue which could be worth a fortune . the brady bunch movie arrived in the middle of a slew of t . v . -to-film re-treads , so it was easy to overlook the fact that there was actually a point to it besides gratuitous nostalgia . even as the film made referrence to "" classic "" brady plots , it also provided the wonderful conceit of sealing the bradys in a bubble of obliviousness while time had marched on for everyone else , and it made for a genuinely entertaining remembrance of a simpler time with simpler problems . a very brady sequel misses the boat on both counts . there isn't nearly enough juxtaposition between the bradys and the modern world ; most of the film seems to take place in the brady house , with only a sarcastic matheson to react . as for the echoes of the original series , the most memorable were already used in the first film . we do get a detailed re-creation of jan's imaginary boyfriend george glass , and token references to other episodes like the hawaiian vacation shows ( don't be fooled by ads which make it look like the entire film is set in hawaii ; the bradys don't hit the islands until about twenty minutes remain ) , but a very brady sequel doesn't provide the same warmth of familiarity . there are a few solid laughs in that sub-plot , but unfortunately it underlines an over-reliance on sexual double-entendre of a staggering obviousness . i suppose a limited time frame to work on a script can make you leap for the easy gag . still , a very brady sequel does have the same superb cast to draw on , and they make for a film which seems more creative than it actually is . jennifer elise cox again has the showcase role of neglected middle child jan , and dumping her psychotic "" inner voice "" makes her desperation for attention a bit more fun . gary cole is also priceless -- it's hard to imagine a more convincingly earnest square , or someone else delivering a line like , "" so what are your plans now that you're alive ?

"parker and the vicious circle ( which , despite its uncomfortable tone , was close to being a conventional movie ) , director alan rudolph has returned to his unique brand of film making with afterglow , a romantic black comedy about love , betrayal , and self-absorption . while these may not be the most unusual themes to fashion into a motion picture , rudolph's atypical approach to the characters and their situations makes for an intriguing , if not always pleasant , movie . it is said that rudolph is a polarizing director ? meaning that most viewers either love his work or hate it . parker , i had not been overly impressed by his movies . parker effort , to be irritating and frustrating . i was somewhat surprised , therefore , to discover that i liked afterglow . there are several reasons for this , but the paramount one is that rudolph seems to have muted some of the most strident , mannered aspects of his approach . the characters here are more like real people with genuine problems , the story is absorbing , and the acting is top-notch . in short , rudolph has created a world that it's worth spending two hours in . the landscape of emotional pain between them is palpable . the romantic couplings of the characters are interesting in that they illustrate the multiple faces of love . sex means something different to everyone ? to jeffrey , it's an unpleasant chore , a loss of control ; to marianne , it's a means to a maternal end ; to lucky , it's an enjoyable distraction that blocks out his marital troubles ; and to phyllis , it's a method of establishing or denying emotional closeness . ultimately , none of these characters appears to love anyone else as much as they love themselves . the greatest strength of the film lies not in the script , but in the performances . those who recall him as sickboy in trainspotting will find that he is almost unrecognizable here as the image of conformity . lara flynn boyle , who wasn't impressive in rudolph's equinox , is greatly improved , making marianne a jumble of sexiness and vulnerability . nick nolte is delightful as the uninhibited lucky , and he manages to deliver some of rudolph's most pregnant lines with practiced ease . her often wry , occasionally cutting asides are the source of much of the film's humor , and there's hardly ever a moment when she doesn't steal the spotlight from her co-stars . i don't know if afterglow is the film to convert rudolph- detractors , but it seems that this movie is a little more accessible than some of the director's earlier productions . enough of his trademark style remains , however , to reassure his supporters . afterglow is basically a four-pronged character study . the plot is not especially compelling , but the character interaction is , and that's the real reason to see this motion picture . rudolph has painted an able picture of the non-romantic side of love -- the one that has more to do with tolerance and familiarity than with affection and attraction . - ingmar bergman",JBe
"director : steve miner . for a while there , i had declared a personal moratorium on disney's live-action formula pictures . although i found cool runnings moderately entertaining , i realized that was about as much as i could expect : a smile here , a chuckle there , something i'd take my kids to see if i had any and wanted to get them out of the house on a saturday afternoon . with the presence of gerard depardieu , i had slightly higher hopes for my father the hero , but i was kidding myself . while he lends a roguish charm to the proceedings , he's still trapped in a movie which seems designed more to divert than to entertain . it would be one thing if my father the hero were simply predictable , which it is , but it is also just badly written . my father the hero is based on a french film i have not seen titled mon pere , ce heros , but it is hard to believe that the characters could have been as fuzzy as they are here . the lies are just a device , and even if we believe it's just adolescence at work there's no particular reason to care . one doesn't necessarily expect well-rounded characters from a film like my father the hero , but one should at leas find reasonably coherent types . still , as silly and incoherent as the script may be , gerard depardieu still gets to read many of the lines , and he has superb comic timing . but it's part of the problem that he has such a rapport with everyone ; if part of the point is that andre needs to become a better father and a more selfless person , we never see any indication that he is anything but a perfectly nice guy , if slightly overprotective . there would have been so many more comic possibilities in a rakish playboy being saddled with everyone's belief that he is a cradle-robber . heigl is lovely as nicole , perhaps too lovely ; i'm not sure why she'd need to lie to hook anyone . my father , the hero is wholesome , good-natured and does virtually nothing to offend . but it needs more than that , namely something to make it worth ninety minutes of anyone's time . gerard depardieu is fun to watch , and proves surprisingly adept at physical comedy . it would have been nice to see him work with a script that seemed to have any imagination or sense of structure behind it .",SRe
"sexual taboos come in all shapes and forms -- bestiality , pedophilia , incest -- but none creates a more vivid image than that of necrophilia . so , when i say that kissed is the character study of a necrophiliac , recognize that this film is intended for a very select audience . anyone who feels incapable of watching a movie that deals frankly with this subject ( even though it is , relatively speaking , tastefully approached ) should steer clear of kissed . director lynne stopkewich's feature is for adventurous movie-goers only . of course , this isn't the first motion picture to broach this "" forbidden "" subject , but it approaches the material in a far more serious and compassionate fashion than anything i can remember . and , as fundamentally unappealing as the concept of having sex with a corpse may be , kissed manages the considerably difficult task of humanizing a character involved in this practice . as a result , kissed isn't nearly as difficult or disturbing a film as one might suppose from a plot description . the central figure in this movie is sandra larson ( molly parker ) , a young woman who , by her own admission , has "" always been fascinated by death -- the smell of it , the feel of it , and the stillness of it .

'' as the two engage in a genial disagreement about what life means , but showing most of all , that they are both good listeners , challenging the audience to carefully listen to a movie more than to watch it . wally tells of playing a cat on stage and how some of the other actors who actually liked him , made negative remarks of how he won't be able to perform properly in that costume . wally believes they said this because it is difficult to express feelings directly to people . andre counters , that we can't be direct so we end up saying the weirdest things . in tibet , he watched as tibetans would have tea in silence , sitting for hours and finding no need to talk if they had nothing to say . we don't have to travel to some exotic place to find reality , it is right here . he also goes on to say , that if you can't react honestly to people-there is a deadness . the dinner seemed to end on an apology for both to go back to their comfortable lifestyles , momentarily exhilarated by the richness of the meal , the cheer of communicating their thoughts , and by the many provoking subjects broached . these two seemed like two smug but likable new york intellectuals , who have a good rap going for them . i thought how riveting the conversation was and how it all ended up being so mundane , titillating but irrelevant . the only thing left savoring was the delicious mood they set . but for the viewer , any one of the numerous topics brought into the conversation , could be a stimulant for further contemplation . i thought the energy and the absurdity of the film , was the intangible grandeur , the something that made this film a special treat , no matter its seemingly bourgeois idealism .",DSc

"although ted demme's life makes you wait until the ending credits , it does eventually deliver on its promising casting . as shown in the outtakes , eddie murphy and martin lawrence can be quite funny together as they flub their lines and generally ham it up . they also show evidence of good chemistry together , something that the body of the movie has trouble demonstrating . how's this for a questionable concept for a movie ? a slice of life story about two prisoners in "" for the long ride "" -- life in prison . the uneventful script by robert ramsey and matthew stone contains little in the way of comedy or drama . and rather than pumping up this modest story , the director restrains his actors . the result is that the audience has to wait until the end for murphy and lawrence to show off their talent . most of the movie has respectable actors delivering reverential performances in a film that lacks much-needed oomph . thanks to set designer dan bishop ( lone star ) , the picture does provide some impressive atmospherics . the prison is not quite as bad a place as it sounds . and for all of the white overseer's bluster , he's frequently more friend than foe . still , there's no way out for prisoners #4316 ( murphy ) and #4317 ( lawrence ) , not that they don't try often enough . their failed attempts , which are never with enough humor , are the story's on-going joke . the movie does contain some nice sections . the story's most poignant scene comes when a convincingly aged lawrence looks for the first time in 30 years at a town full of people . ending first with a nicely ambiguous twist , the movie then feels compelled to spell everything out for us . after unleashing our imaginations , why does the film have to treat us like little kids who have to know all the answers ? do they think we would demand our money back if the film left some doubt as to the story's precise resolution ? it is rated r for some profanity , violence and mature themes and would be fine for teenagers .",SRh

"it's been more than fifteen years since the release of john carpenter's halloween , and ten since wes craven's a nightmare on elm street arrived on the big screen . each , in its own way , was a top-of- the-line horror flick--a film that relied more on chills and thrills than on graphic displays of butchery . those movies had unique visions of what was required to scare an audience , and neither resorted to the pointless and grotesque displays of gratuitous gore that permeated the other "" big "" entry of the time ( friday the 13th ) . but then came the inevitable sequels , and the corresponding plummet in quality . making a cheap buck took precedence over everything--including telling a good story . halloween 2 was steeped in blood . nightmare 2 , not directed by wes craven , lacked even a coherent story . by the end of the '80s , it was difficult to discern much difference between the various screen bogeymen : jason , michael , and freddy . it was still gore-happy , but its baddie , freddy , had a self-deprecating sense of humor ( his one-liners reminded one of the kinds of things that arnold schwarzenegger was wont to spout ) . by the fifth nightmare sequel , the films had become self- parodies . so why do another nightmare movie ? probably , as new line cinema exec robert shaye puts it ( in a cameo in this new entry ) , because the public wants it . the freddy krueger mask is still a pretty hot seller in halloween costume stores . perhaps the best turn of events is the return of wes craven , directing a nightmare for the first time since the original . he has returned a sense of genuine horror to the series , in part by taking it to completely new ground , and in part by giving his actors a legitimate script to work with . for his part , craven ( who also appears in the film ) is writing a new script ( which turns out to be the screenplay for this picture ) . those who can accept the basic premise are likely to have nearly as much fun . this isn't quite cinema verite , but at its most clever , it comes close--a sort of big-budget , horror version of my life's in turnaround . the only argument against craven's vision is that he perhaps didn't push the envelope far enough . the visual and gore effects , while not ilm top-of- the-line , are believable and occasionally downright chilling . the entire production is steeped in an unsettling atmosphere . the cinematic horror genre , like the science fiction one , has been badly hamstrung by poor films , and several of the nightmare on elm street entries have been at the forefront of the decline . therefore , it's somewhat ironic that one of the most intelligent and creative efforts to come along in a while bears the nightmare theme , title , and signature villain . any copycat features spawned by this movie will hopefully take a cue from wes craven's new nightmare and favor quality of scares over quantity of blood .",JBe
""" the dialogue . "" "" the dialogue . "" "" what about the dialogue ? "" "" nothing , i'm just talking . "" "" i know you're talking , but what the * * * * are you saying ? "" just this : because it is so easy to get caught up in david mamet's distinctive brand of rat-a-tat , profanity-laden dialogue , it is even easier not to notice that he may be one of america's most deeply humanist playwrights . oleanna , for all its incendiary subject matter , had its foundations in a frustration over societal impediments to communication ; glengarry glen ross showed the business world hammering people into the ground . the twenty year old american buffalo was one of mamet's first plays , and it retains the ferocity of youth in its film incarnation , a set-bound but affecting study of trust and the lack thereof . it is a challenge to make a play work on the screen , particularly if the play is as dialogue-heavy as a david mamet play , and director michael corrente ( federal hill ) seems content to follow the lead of film versions of oleanna and glengarry glen ross by refusing to "" open up "" the action . american buffalo takes place almost entirely in one location -- don's store -- and there are times when the production begins to feel very cramped and oppressive . it is a bleak tale filmed in bleak tones , but corrente retains a necessary urgency . he also has two sensational lead actors and one up-and-comer to play the key roles , and they make american buffalo even more compelling . hoffman brings to the role the dissolute swagger of ratso rizzo , and while that makes the characterization familiar , it doesn't make it any less intriguing . there is a slight weak link in sean nelson , who made an electrifying debut in 1994's fresh but appears to have grown more self-conscious ; he clearly never quite gets a handle on mamet-speak . still , when the three actors share the climactic final scene , they refuse to surrender your attention . mamet is very much an acquired taste , and the taste of buffalo will be unappetizing to many . as a film , american buffalo is not spectacular , but it brings a great play to a wider audience , and that alone makes it noteworthy . those who might find it too pessimistic should think of it instead as a plea for a society where we can trust again , as mamet's raging attack on a world where civilization hangs by a thread and where friendship isn't worth a nickel .",SRe

"i have no idea whether equinox is a cleverly-devised satire on these kinds of "" identity movies , "" or whether it's a bad melodramatic addition to the genre . this ambiguity in itself is not a good sign , since if the director was going for the parody , he should have done something to tip off the viewers . instead , while we get a few hints that this might be the case , there are at least as many pointing to the other alternative . the characters are all weird . not "" weird "" in a delightful , quirky sense , but in a way that feels annoying . there's no one to relate to , and writer/director alan rudolph doesn't attempt to make any of his principals accessible to the audience . the rest of the cast populating this movie is no more healthy . except in a few places where rudolph makes it clear that he's poking fun at something , the dialogue is atrocious . most of the lines spoken by henry sound scripted ( rather than natural ) , and freddy is constantly spitting out hard-boiled dialogue from a grade b detective flick . there are times when it's almost painful to listen to these people speak . the acting is uniformly unimpressive--ranging from pedestrian to downright bad . he's better as freddy than henry , but neither role is a masterpiece of subtlety , and it's clear that his grasp of either character is limited . lara flynn boyle isn't particularly impressive either . it seems that she , like modine , felt a need to go over-the-top to show the emotional fragility of beverly . there are a few instances when she's on-target , but those are the exception rather than the rule . as henry's neighbor rosie the prostitute , marisa tomei uses her characteristically energetic style to overcome dramatic lapses in her performance . her scenes ( even though most of them include modine ) are the high points of this film . a pair of normally-reliable actors , fred ward and m . emmett walsh , produce characters with flatter personalities than what they're capable of , which opens up the question of how responsible the director is for the work of those acting in equinox . ward at least avoids embarrassing himself . not so for walsh , who is hideous as he goes way over-the-top . it's too bad that equinox is so riddled with problems , because there's a lot of soil here ripe for tilling . while there's nothing new in the premise of twins with radically different personalities , this has a unique angle that , if produced more coherently , could have been the foundation for a genuinely worthwhile movie . even given all the problems of equinox , there's something in the concept that encourages the viewer to stick with it , if for no other reason than to see what happens if and when the twins finally meet . actually , henry's life alone is worthy of a movie . freddy isn't a very interesting character , and there are few scenes with him that provoke more than a passing interest , but henry has a fascinating life . more time is spent on his affair with beverly , but there's still a lot left unexplored . a few more scenes with these two might have helped the movie immensely . equinox's basic storyline is interesting enough to have held my interest for the one-hundred plus minutes . however , from the beginning , i was aware of how saturated with problems the film's execution is . beyond the initial draft of the plot skeleton , nothing appears to have been done right . casting is dubious , scriptwriting sophomoric , and direction contributing to , rather than alleviating , faults . if the viewer chooses to look at equinox as a straight spoof , the movie still doesn't work , although many of the worst scenes take on a less embarrassing tone . given that perception , however , there's too much that no longer makes sense , such as why there are so many dry , straight scenes , including an ending that's designed to deliver a "" powerful "" message . this is a hard film to decipher , and one that's not really worth the effort .",JBe

"thirteen days , starring and produced by kevin costner , depicts this famous period . as a history lesson , it is absolutely engrossing , but , as a movie , it falls short of what it should have been able to achieve . although the film is well worth seeing and clearly gets a hit , with this material it should have gotten a home run . directed by roger donaldson , whose dubious credentials include his most recent films , dante's peak and species , and scripted by david self , whose only credit is the laughably bad the haunting , thirteen days is perhaps as good as could be expected . greenwood's bland performance is emblematic of what is wrong with the movie , namely that it gets itself bogged down in long , slowly paced interior scenes in which the strategy is planned . but when the movie cuts back and forth between the politics on the ground and the excitement of the ships at sea and the planes in the air , the film really comes alive . pointed at the united states , these missiles could reach almost as far as seattle and could kill most american citizens within minutes . it is only partially successful . trevor jones's music for the picture is the old-fashioned melodramatic type . but the acting is generally too reserved . when the director allows emotions to come to the surface , the movie has the impact that it should . thirteen days is definitely a movie with an explicit message . besides the fantastic history lesson , the movie leaves us to ponder the veracity of its anti-military message and to wonder how much revisionist history is taking place . it is rated pg-13 for brief strong language and would be acceptable for any kid old enough to be interested in this period in history .",SRh
"rather , it is a sort of pakistani version of the commitments , with the focus of the band being country/western music rather than r&b . wild west is a culture clash movie with a twist . this time , it's not pakistanis trying to fit in with whites , but pakistanis trying to be accepted as country/western musicians . the film has the good sense to approach this issue--not to mention several others--with a fair dose of humor , so while the point is made , it's accomplished without a sermon . this is a lighthearted romp , not a lugubrious piece of moralizing . director david attwood has managed to infuse his entire film with energy and zest--not only the characters , but the story itself . if the pacing is occasionally erratic , it's because attwood rarely slows down , and when he does ( usually for a moment of straight drama--such as the scenes where zaf's mother talks to him about going to pakistan ) , the audience feels the lull . occasionally , the film is a little too obvious . attwood creates a number of intentional stereotypes , but these don't always work . the "" typical american "" record producers are an example . as sendups , this pair is a little too annoying ( although the biting satire surrounding them fits wild west's mood perfectly ) . wild west never attains the flair of the commitments . in the first place , the music isn't as good or as all-pervasive . additionally , attwood's film is never that concerned about burrowing under the characters' skins . wild west isn't shallow , but it glosses over numerous issues to preserve the light tone . this could have easily become a dark , brooding motion picture . all the performers are likeable . naveen andrews shows good range as zaf , and seems perfectly at home in a cowboy hat and jacket . ameet chana , who plays the honky tonk cowboys' manager , gives an occasionally-hilarious over-the-top performance , seizing on every americanism and cliche he can find . wild west works because of its reckless spirit . the message about people's intolerance of diversity comes across all the more clearly because it isn't shrouded in long speeches and mournful testimonials . david attwood has chosen his medium well for wild west to become something with a little more substance than a typical farce .",JBe

"director and writer trevor nunn's ( hedda and lady jane ) twelfth night proves my thesis that even a mediocre film adaptation of one of the bard's plays is well worth savoring . trevor nunn's lady jane was a touching piece of filmmaking , but his twelfth night is fairly inaccessible due to the by-the-numbers acting of most of the principals . the adaptation of the text is quite literal , but the passion and the chemistry is not up to par . according to the film's press kit , twelfth night is "" the most popular of all of shakespeare's comedies .

"in order to get you started , your first assignment will be something simple . you are to write one of those canonical thrillers in which the old reporter searches almost in vain for leads . you can use that old plot device of a clock that counts down the hours . this will provide some pseudo-tension to make up for any shortcomings in your script . make it look like the protagonist has found almost no useful clues until the last act , when near miracles can occur . let's say we have a man on death row . give the reporter less than a dozen hours to solve the crime in hopes that you'll at least have some of the audience on the edge of their seats . now focus all of your creative energy on that obligatory big scene toward the end in which the obviously innocent man is about to be executed . think of all of the ways that you can manipulate the viewers' emotions . if you can get them to cry , you've got 'em hooked . anyone who cries during a movie feels duty bound to recommend it . don't worry that the critics will call the scene manipulative and maudlin ; they don't buy the tickets . and if you're really fortunate , your agent will find you some big name stars to act in the movie , say clint eastwood as the reporter . if they get clint , he'll probably want to direct it as well . make the crime be over some trivial amount , say $96 . clint , in his full laid-back mode , can sometimes put audiences to sleep , so hope that they'll cast some edgier actors against him . denis leary would make a good no-nonsense boss for clint . if you can get him , james woods as leary's boss would certainly add explosive and humorous power to every scene he is in and would likely steal the movie . the studio will probably assign other writers to the project to "" help "" you . whatever you do , don't be too disappointed with the results . don't forget that your script is just the score , and you have no control if the director decides to conduct it too slowly . finally , with a strong enough cast , the movie will be entertaining even if far from memorable . next time , you can tackle something a little more challenging , like say a teen comedy . it is rated r for profanity and some violence and would be fine for teenagers .",SRh
"screenplay : thomas vinterberg and mogens rukov . director : thomas vinterberg . mpaa rating : unrated ( could be r for adult themes , nudity and profanity ) running time : 101 minutes . more to the point , it's a family that makes you feel better about your own unhappy family . that's the kind of character truth "" dogma '95 "" -- a manifesto for a return to bare bones filmmaking created by several leading danish directors -- was supposed to engender . yet at times the celebration feels forced and artificial , merely in a different way than the forced and artifical genre films implicitly criticized by dogma '95 . others feel silly , like the machinations of the family cook to help air the dirty laundry . but good or bad , all the reactions spring from a bombshell rather than the typical exchanges of small artillery that make for most family tension . it all seems terribly unnecessary considering how perceptively vinterberg and co-scripter mogens rukov capture the more mundane animosity and foolishness of family gatherings . vinterberg and his exceptional cast -- thomas bo larsen is particularly good as the younger son overflowing with toxic anger -- find moments of greatness in these simple conflicts . indeed , vinterberg's point may have been that the more extreme example of family crisis that supercedes the others is more common than we'd like to believe . if so , it still feels like an authenticity that draws too much attention to itself . curiously , the same could be said for the rigid film-making prescriptions of the dogma '95 . the hand-held camerawork , washed-out video-to-film cinematography , location shooting and absence of underscore music were intended to subsume "" auteurism "" in favor of story , but they simply become an auteurism of a different sort . as effectively as the location serves to intensify the claustrophobia of a family forced to confront its demons , the look and sound of the celebration -- or lack thereof -- just make you aware of how different this film looks and sounds than other films , exactly when the familiarity of the situations should come into focus . some might argue the same was true of the most notable previous dogma '95 effort , lars von trier's breaking the waves . yet in that film , the style supported the instability of the main character's world ; thematically , the look was of a piece with the story . in the celebration , that same look works far less effectively , because it feels like an exercise rather than a choice . when vinterberg nails the truth of basic family interaction , it's easy to overlook that exercise . later , when a dramatic plot point takes over , it starts to seem that too much has been imposed on these characters from without -- a bad dogma starts to run over all its great karma . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line "" subscribe "" .",SRe

"joel schumacher's modestly budgeted , gritty looking war melodrama had nothing relevant to say , only saying things that have been said in countless other vietnam war films . the clich ? d hero and the formulaic story never caught my fancy , no matter how much the director tried to make things happen . it's in the style of the first half of full metal jacket , but without the same impact . it's the tale of a soldier who won't conform to the army and by the film's end proves he's not a bad guy and can also be an excellent soldier if he wants to . there were just no surprises forthcoming , as the film seemed to be marking time until it shows him as a leader and proves himself heroic . i think that schumacher thinks because he has no stars and shot this one in a grainy 16-millimeter with a jumpy hand-held camera and with mostly natural light in dogme style , that he caught something cinema v ? rit ? . what goes with schumacher wherever , is a lot of corn . this film is just as weak in storyline as was his big commercial flick batman . what this film has going for it , is some good shots of the swampland in fort polk , louisiana , and some good performances . the movie moves along as if it were on a forced march to hanoi . there's also some liberal claptrap thrown into the storyline , which is unconvincingly done about a racist sociopath . the film heads toward its less than 'big bang' finale in tigerland with the same forced messages about war that could not only chase sluts out of a hotel room but drive film critics to the theater's popcorn vender rather than sit through this torture in its entirety . the director must receive credit for at least getting together a good cast , though i would have loved to see this one with a ed wood jr . cast .",DSc
"a sometimes funny parody and uncanny black comedy , about incest , sexual repression , and the jewish mob . but its failure to be consistently on focus with its characters' comings and goings , in what seems like a pointless amount of gore being displayed , acts to undermine the film's artful plot set-up . as the film is too often off target , bringing up too many subjects for it to handle , it just fires away , taking aim at everything in its way and missing just as often as it hits . the breaking of the nose gives rise to the saying , i could have beaten him six ways to sunday . there is no smooth sailing in this difficult story to behold , which might have something to do with love . if love is the message here , it is not the conventional kind , but it is one that is stranger and stronger than harry's repressions , hatred and violence . everytime one looks up on the screen , someone seems to be getting violently bumped off , yet harry manages to survive and will leave youngstown with iris by the film's end , which , oddly enough , after all the mayhem and absurdity of harry's insane life , the film turns out to have a temporarily happy ending . this might be the strangest thing about this film , for a film that has gone out of its way to be stranger than fiction or love . this film should appeal mostly to those who like offbeat stories and their comedy to be darker than black , and don't mind if confusion is the main ingredient that propels the story . i took it at face value to be black comedy and found myself laughing often , though the people i saw it with , thought it was over-the-top in blood and gore , and found little in it to like and found the film was far too self-indulgent to work as a love story for them .",DSc

"it's easy to describe two plus one as another generation x motion picture . coming out in the wake of such films as bodies , rest and motion , threesome , and reality bites , two plus one immediately shows similarities and differences to those mainstream motion pictures . for one thing , the characters in this , director eugene martin's first feature , seem more real . their problems are of the sort that everyday people encounter , not the too-obviously scripted dilemmas of the other films . as martin says , "" [two plus one] doesn't sound much different in its description from some of these other films , but hopefully when people get in there , they see themselves up there . it's different from some other 'generation x' type movies that i think are a little too marketed , and they're being rejected because of that .

"unforgettable isn't . although i was tempted to leave those two lines as the whole review , i will tell you more . last year , usually excellent director john dahl ( the last seduction and red rock west ) made a film about memory transferal . i did not see the film when it came out , unless i saw it and forgot it , but it is now available on pay per view where i think i saw it for the first time . unforgettable is a confused film that can't figure out what it wants to be . sometimes the script by bill geddie thinks it wants to be a thriller , but other times it tries to be sci-fi flick . at its worst , it descends into a picture with horror show overtones . if the blood doesn't get to you , then the editing makes the film into such a whirl that you feel like you are on a roller coaster where various murders flash by your eyes in a dizzying collage . the film opens with a gory crime scene . all of the cops still think he did it . yes , this is a movie that taxes your ability to suspend disbelief . he retorts , "" i'm telling you your formula works , and you're talking to me about rats ?

( this is one of those good shows -- sling blade was another -- which will immediately be written off by many people as soon as the plot is described . afterall , not many moviegoers go to the entertainment section looking for a good cockroach film . ) the shadowy mood combined with the script's proper sense of timing -- the best monster movies delay our first complete view of the monster as long as possible -- yields a film that builds its terror properly . just as some of the sexiest films are those in which the people stay fully dressed but seem always on the verge of taking off their clothes , so it is with monster movies , the tease is the key . in the entire first hour of mimic , the monster , in the form of a shadowy figure of a man in a cloak , is seen only in glimpses . marco beltrami's eerie and foreboding music adds to the ever-present feeling that death is right around the corner . almost all of the story happens three years later , and -- you guessed it -- the judas breed did not die out , but instead mutated into something dastardly and human-sized . of course , at first we don't know that for sure . as in all horror films , people do stupid things . in fact the light of flickering bad florescent lights and low-wattage incandescent bulbs adds dramatically to the horrific ambiance . figures in the background are seen , but escape just before being noticed as the audience whispers a collective "" look out !

"" the script is full of references to past films . the show has many well done small touches . hang out with these guys for a while , and you may begin to feel sorry for them . they have lots of theories , but actually not a clue as to how to relate to women . only mike is a whole person , and we grow to care about him thanks to jon favreau's sympathetic and heartfelt performance . the rest of the guys deserve their empty lives . it is rated r solely for the language which i thought fairly tame considering the subject matter . there is no violence , nudity , or sex although there are a lot of discussions about sex . the film would be fine for any teenager interested in the film . i had several good laughs and liked the show enough to recommend it and give it  .",SRh
"actually , it isn't a western per se , but more of a modern-day fairy tale . certainly , a great deal of what happens is beyond the realm of reality and requires a willing suspension of disbelief . director mike newell perhaps put it best when he said , "" there are certain things that happen in the film that cannot happen unless the world is a very odd , mysterious , and unreal sort of place . "" in typical fairy tale fashion , there's a clear delineation between who the audience is supposed to sympathize with and who they aren't . at the end , the good guys are rewarded and the bad guys get their comeuppance , so those who don't like happy endings might be galled by into the west's final moments . then again , newell isn't known for doing downbeat projects . the juxtaposition of reality and fantasy somehow doesn't gel perfectly . the blending of the two is not seamless , and this sometimes makes the story's progression feel forced and unnatural . also , for most of the movie , i was wondering if there was a point to all of this . ultimately , there is--and a very telling one at that--but you have to wait the entire picture to discover it . the two young actors who play tito and ossie are excellent with expressions and actions , but young ciaran fitzgerald has trouble delivering believable dialogue . occasionally , his lines seem stilted and learned , rather than spontaneous . into the west has its heart in the right place , even if frequently defies logic . the movie is not nearly as endearing as newell's previous film , enchanted april , nor is it as poignant as screenwriter jim sheridan's my left foot , but it has its moments , and is definitely suitable for all but the youngest of children . like the secret garden , it has moments to captivate adults as well , even if it lacks some of the emotional depth and serene beauty of that film . this is a nice family adventure--certainly not a great movie , but a solid one .",JBe
"romance by writer/director catherine breillat is described in the press notes as "" a daring exploration of female sexuality from a female point of view .

"even at his most vicious , stewart maintains a debonair style and sly wit that automatically make his villains more interesting than the run-of-the-mill sort . unfortunately , in masterminds , the distinguished actor is literally the only worthwhile piece of flotsam bobbing around on a sea of hackneyed sewage . masterminds is bad . unfortunately , it's not bad in a freespirited , campy sense -- it's bad in a way that makes it painful to endure . this is one of those motion pictures where i found myself looking at my watch with increasing regularity , wondering about the virtues of walking out on the film , and praying that the projectionist would accidentally leave out a reel or two . ( plot-wise , such an omission wouldn't have mattered -- the movie is so obvious that it would have been simple to guess what was missing . ) director roger christian , whose resume highlights several virtually-unknown features , is obviously a big fan of die hard , since this film is the most blatant rip-off i've seen , right down to all the little plot devices ( like the walkie-talkie communication with an ally on the outside ) . in fact , christian and screenwriter floyd byars are so aware that they're stealing from die hard that they even include a line to that effect ( "" we have a die hard situation here ! "" ) . actually , it's possible to re-use the die hard material effectively ; my complaint with masterminds is that it manages to ruin things at every turn . instead of this being a pulse-pounding rollercoaster ride of adrenaline , it's a pointless bore . everything that was special about die hard has been negated here by careless writing , bad acting , and pedestrian direction . aside from stewart , the only thing that kept me interested was trying to figure out what kind of bizarre accent brenda fricker uses . as far as i can tell , there are three rules that must be followed for any action film to attain a degree of success . the first is that the movie must maintain some level of credibility ; this film gives new meaning to the term preposterous ( for example , no one gets hurt or even seriously injured , despite numerous explosions and one electrocution ) . second , the action must be exciting and there must be a sense that the protagonist's life is in danger . nothing could be further from the truth here , where the big scenes are just excuses to blow things up . finally , and most importantly , it's necessary for the audience to develop a rapport with the main character . in masterminds , that's difficult , if not impossible , because ozzie is such a snot . as the movie progressed , i kept hoping he would get shot or crushed or incinerated . i never liked him , and if there's any reason to root for raif , it's because he has such an obnoxious opponent . kartheiser , who was last seen in alaska , has mastered the ability to really annoy a viewer . masterminds represents the pinnacle of action movie tediousness , the kind of film that makes me yearn for mediocrity . by comparison , the moribund speed 2 zipped along at a breakneck pace . this film appears to have been written by a member of the target audience , and possesses a grade-school intelligence level ( ironic , considering the title ) . that way , there will be no need to entertain thoughts of a sequel -- something that the final scene clearly has in mind .

"the public relations people at universal pictures are going out of their way to emphasize that the jackal is not a remake of fred zinnemann's 1973 masterpiece , the day of the jackal . while acknowledging that this new motion picture is based on the original , producer james jacks stressed that the first film's "" central premise [serves] as the basis for a whole new suspense thriller . "" actually , the more distance the studio places between the two films , the better , because the 1997 production can't hold a candle to the 1973 release , and an attempted comparison only makes the new bruce willis/richard gere vehicle look worse . anyone who believes the least inspired remake to star willis was last man standing ( a re-working of a fistful of dollars/yojimbo ) may have reason to re-think that position after seeing this movie . not much , and certainly not any sense of true suspense . the jackal is so lifeless that there are times when it's in danger of putting the audience into a coma . this time , the jackal is played by an uncharismatic bruce willis , whose interpretation does little to efface the mark left by edward fox . beyond the bare-bones plot skeleton , however , screenwriter chuck pfarrer has changed a lot , albeit little for the better . and director michael- caton jones , who did wonderful work on both scandal and rob roy , fails to connect with this material . like val kilmer in the saint , he's a master of disguise , although willis is recognizable no matter what color his hair is , what clothes he's wearing , or how much makeup he has on . the problem is that the chase , which should be a taut nail-biter , is dull . yes , it zips from country-to-country , globe trotting from moscow to helsinki to montreal to washington d . c . to chicago , but , aside from a few interesting explorations into the complexity of the jackal's methods , there's very little of interest here . in the original the day of the jackal , the buildup was the payoff . here , it's just filler while we're waiting for the predictable final show-down between the two leads . and , if you can't guess how that turns out , you don't see many movies . in the place of genuine tension , the jackal resorts to bloody violence . plot contrivances abound as well . aside from the gaping holes in logic , there's the simple matter of the jackal's supposed intelligence . i say "" supposed , "" because there are times when he comes across as a borderline-moron . stares at him for an inordinately long time , then smirks once or twice -- that's the method of a hollywood invention , not a believable expert . it's easy to see willis' performance as icy -- the jackal is completely emotionless throughout . gere , on the other hand , doesn't do much to infuse mulqueen with tangible passion , although the actor is better here than in his recent anti-chinese flop , red corner ( and his irish brogue is an improvement over some of the recent accents we've been subjected too ) . in supporting roles , sydney poitier exudes more dignity than the film deserves , and diane venora is credible as a tough-as-nails mvd officer . the jackal starts strongly , but it doesn't take long for the film to devolve into a series of familiar formulas . and , without a sense of mounting tension or at least a few interesting characters , the movie's trajectory propels us into a realm of burgeoning boredom . despite being 30 minutes shorter than its 1973 inspiration , this incarnation feels three times as long .

"both are completely believable and deliver strong performances , but carrillo steals the movie in a long dramatic scene towards the end . although it is a powerful film at times , loach makes two strategic mistakes that significantly and needlessly detract from its message . brody , a tom green look-alike who darts around like harpo marx , gives the movie a comedic side that is jarringly out of place with the rest of the drama . the second mistake concerns the subtitles . since the characters would naturally speak a mixture of english and spanish , loach keeps switching the language that is being subtitled . in theory this may sound sensible , but in practice it is a disaster . if you try to read the subtitles and they turn out to be in a language you don't understand , then , by the time you stop reading and start listening , you've missed the first few words of the sentence and are frequently unable to parse what is being said . the reverse is true if you're listening carefully , only to realize that you should have been reading . since these switches may occur several times per minute , it is hard to keep track of the dialog . if loach felt that dual language subtitling were necessary , there are two ways that would have solved the problem . either have both languages subtitled all of the time -- films shown in multilingual countries like switzerland do this -- or use different colors with , say , white for english and yellow for spanish . bread and roses makes some powerful points for the union while reminding us of everyone's believe in self-reliance . were it not for the miscasting of the comical adrien brody in a serious part and for the distracting and constant switching of subtitles , i would have been able to recommend bread and roses . it is rated r for strong language and brief nudity and would be acceptable for teenagers . just send me a letter with the word "" subscribe "" in the subject line .",SRh
"a few months ago , i was at a press screening for another touchstone film which was preceded by a teaser trailer for mission to mars . as the trailer unfolded , the critics in the audience began to snicker with increasing frequency . the imagery used was startling similar to images from 2001 : a space odyssey -- an astronaut in a white room , an approach to a dark object in the distance , a figure spinning off into space . it was comical not just because of the familiarity , but because it seemed so quintessentially brian de palma . the train station sequence in the untouchables came from eisenstein's potemkin ; the single-take opening sequence in snake eyes felt like welles' touch of evil ; whole heaping chunks of his early films appropriated hitchcockian devices and themes . so why wouldn't de palma take on the most iconic science-fiction film ever made while making his first science-fiction film ? why not add kubrick to his list of victims of auteur homage ? it's more alarming that it's similar to the cookie-cutter hollywood approach to any story . the frustrating thing about any brian de palma film is that you can always count on at least one extended sequence where you realize what a brilliant technical craftsman he can be . a chain reaction of events following that accident keeps building tension , leading to some genuinely tense moments . de palma's sense for timing this sort of sequence is impeccable -- recall the editing of tom cruise's computer room break-in in mission : impossible -- leading to the hope that mission to mars can maintain that sort of visual and emotional energy . and then you remember this is brian de palma . every once in a while , by sheer twisted accident , de palma ends up working with a rich , smart script -- the untouchables , blow out , carlito's way . more often , you get the impression that he looks for a script with a few places he can show off his visual flair . mission to mars has its showcase sequence , but it also has a leaden script full of plug-and-play characterizations . it's the sort of mawkish back-story screenwriters use all the time in adventure films , in a token -- and usually futile -- attempt to show that the people matter more than the concept . ironically , mission to mars is that rare case where the concept does matter more than the people . when mission to mars gets metaphysical , it makes sure there's someone on hand to narrate every brutally obvious revelation , and someone whose individual journey to wholeness will be completed by this close encounter . this film doesn't end with the awe of creation ; it ends with tedious exposition topped off by an interplanetary clasping of hands . there are flashes of brian de palma the visceral thrill-master in mission to mars , but he doesn't seem to know what to do with its limp conclusion . this time around , it probably would have been a good idea . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .",SRe

"screenplay : david twohy . director : deran sarafian . most of the time , i see a new movie on its opening weekend , and it's not just so that my reviews can be fairly fresh . such was not the case with terminal velocity , which had the chance to accumulate a mountain of negative response in the two weeks between its opening and my screening . it's difficult to preduct how those pre-conceptions will affect my own reaction . in this case , they allowed me to be pleasantly surprised . terminal velocity is frenetic and uneven , but it has a certain bone-headed charm thanks to charlie sheen's improbably dense hero . sheen plays richard "" ditch "" brody , a skydiving instructor with something of a reckless streak . the plot of terminal velocity is not exactly what you would call inspired ; it's basically classic hitchcock crossed with classic james bond . the plot's few twists and turns are spelled out in huge letters from the outset , and a bit clumsy in the execution . equally distracting is a tone which careens from brutal to near slapstick in moments , making for a schizophrenic experience which isn't as purely enjoyable as it might be . director deran sarafian drives the action forward relentlessly , which is usually an ideal choice for a film of this genre , but often seems merely hyperactive here . terminal velocity sometimes feels like a cockroach race -- moving fast , but in no particular direction . its saving graces are the characterizations and interaction of charlie sheen and nastassja kinski . sheen's ditch brody is just a handful of brain celss removed from his goofball hot shots ! persona , but it's a character that comes off as extremely refreshing in an action thriller . rather than being either inordinately brilliant or dumber than virtually everyone in the audience , ditch is just simple . he is quite entertaining in scenes where he is infuriated by kinski's references to his dim-wittedness , but he maintains a kind of affable puppy-dog eagerness to please . it's a simple gesture , but funny because it's clear this is no rocket scientist we're dealing with . that rescue , a wildly inventive stunt , is certainly terminal velocity's highlight . it's a gag worthy of the best bond films , and it sends terminal velocity off on a note of high energy . but it's not an isolated moment . terminal velocity is full of well-staged action sequences , and twohy's dialogue is rich with fine one-liners . though it sometimes seems a bit too busy and scattershot for its own good , it's still a perfectly enjoyable no-brainer worth a few solid laughs .",SRe

"i'm not rappaport , herb gardner's 1986 tony award winning play , comes to the screen with the actor gardner had originally envisioned in the lead role . although judd hirsch won his own tony for playing nat in the broadway version , gardner had always wanted to see walter matthau's interpretation of the character . but , when the opportunity arose to make a movie adaptation , gardner approached matthau , who agreed enthusiastically . yet , while this film has much of the irascible charm and wit of the earlier movie , it is more affecting and churns deeper waters . in grumpy old men , we laugh at the characters because they are silly , funny , and likable . in i'm not rappaport , we laugh with them because we understand not only who they are , but who they wish they had become . and , while most of their efforts are ultimately ineffective , it isn't until the very end that we , like them , recognize that even apparent failures can be successes . several minor characters occasionally cross nat and midge's paths . for the most part , the plot is incidental . what matters in i'm not rappaport are the characters and their dialogue . over the two-plus hour running time , nat and midge touch on an amazing variety of subjects : unions and bosses ( "" their tactics haven't changed in one century "" ) , age ( "" an old man like me , i could wander through the world like a ghost "" ) , memories ( "" nostalgia kills more of us than heart disease "" ) , and the war between idealism and realism ( "" i got smarter -- i fought in battles i thought i could win "" ) . they talk and talk and talk , and they're always a delight to listen to , whether we're hearing nat's tall stories or midge's less fanciful reflections . i'm not rappaport reveals its characters in steps . because nat and midge are played by matthau and davis , a pair of "" audience-friendly "" performers , we're prone to like them , but it isn't until we spend some time in their company that our initial impressions are validated . with a similar economy of scenes , we gain a wealth of insight into midge's personality -- he's an ex-prize fighter on the ropes . matthau and davis have both invested a great deal of heart and energy into this production , and it shows . while their names on the marquee all-but-ensure an element of quality in any film , their work in i'm not rappaport represents a mark of distinction for each of them . the supporting performers are all solid -- each gets one prominent scene to compliment , but not eclipse , the leads . i'm not rappaport is the kind of movie that grows on you . it's obviously a play that has been adapted for the cinema , but that doesn't take anything away from the delicate magic that gardner has conjured by his use of sly comedy and keen social insight . while it's true that this is essentially a buddy movie , it's a very special one . nat and midge's friendship reminds us of what bonding really is -- and it doesn't have anything to do with dodging bullets or running away from exploding buildings . in the final analysis , this motion picture is far more about a rapport than a rappaport .",JBe

"rain man was not about dustin hoffman's raymond babbitt . there are some who find the film overly sentimental , and others who consider hoffman's oscar-winning performance little more than a gimmick , but it's hard to argue that the basic structure of the story wasn't what it had to be . raymond couldn't be that character , because it's absurd to build a narrative around the idea that someone with a profound emotional/psychological condition can decide through a simple act of will to be better . this lesson is offered to explain why chuck & buck , for all the quirky things it does right , is ultimately an experience somewhere between improbable and downright insulting . there's a lot of interesting stuff built into the premise , including a not-particularly-twisty twist that still generates a bit more interest in the chuck/buck dynamic . white's performance as buck is pitched just right , somewhere between endearing and creepy in his striped t-shirt and perpetually blow-pop-stuffed grin . director miguel arteta's choice of digital video seems an ill-advised one dramatically -- why heighten the immediacy and realism of a story centered around somebody's fantasy world ? -- but the technology and hand-held movement are rarely distracting . throw in an infectiously innocuous theme song to set the tone , and you've got the raw material for some solid whacked-out drama and dark comedy . and that raw material is left to rot . but charlie is a huge sucking black hole of a characterization , left utterly bereft of personality or motivations in chris weitz's performance and white's script . he's merely a target of obsession , carelessly created because white never intends for the story to be about anything but buck . chuck & buck's resolution is centered around the idea that 15 years of juvenile infantilism are as easy to toss off as a striped t-shirt . chuck & buck's saving grace is a sub-plot that ultimately has little to do with the ostensibly main plot -- buck's attempt to mount a production of a play he has written about his childhood friendship , called hank & frank . a short film entirely about the play within the play might have been great fun , unburdened by the need for grand third-act shifts of character . chuck & buck sinks thanks to a fundamental misunderstanding of how to structure a plot with a plausible character arc . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .",SRe
"in disney's the tigger movie , tigger is busily searching for a tree , but not just any tree . in a world in which every kid's movie works hard to morph into a full-fledged family movie by blending woody allen adult humor with star wars special effects , the tigger movie is a delightful throwback to a simpler time -- a time when every kid's movie didn't feel obligated to throw in vague sexual innuendoes and transparent bathroom humor and a time when the animation didn't look like it was prepared on computers sophisticated enough for nuclear weapons simulation . this charming little picture , based on the beloved a . a . milne children's books , sets itself a modest goal of entertaining a crowded room full of squirming youngsters and attains it admirably . ( actually , just keeping a bunch of little kids in their seats with their eyes transfixed to the screen is probably rather an ambitious goal , as any parent can attest . ) the more amazing part of the simple story is the pleasant effect that it has on the adults . without a single line that they can call their own , the old fogies in the audience will find themselves just as touched by these wonderfully sweet characters . granted , not a lot happens in the movie , but the drawings are handsome and the characters compelling and lively . tigger , voiced by jim cummings , who also does the voice of winnie the pooh , does what tiggers do best , which is lots of bouncing . a high-spirited and good-spirited character , tigger is a character who deserves his own movie . among the latter , a particularly good example has tigger describing his little buddy roo as "" lacking in the perpendicular . "" the gorgeous animation uses picture book images rather than realism in the drawing . this gives the movie a lush look that reminds you of illustrated books from your childhood . the movie sometimes comes back to the book itself and lets the drawings on the pages come alive . among the show's other delights is a song-and-dance dream sequence featuring rows of tiggers performing in everything from chorus lines to synchronized swimming . the message of the film is an old-fashioned one lifted straight out of the wizard of oz : there's no place like home . like the rest of the movie , it's a sweet and simple theme , which is delivered with understated delicacy . the tigger movie runs just 1 : 16 . it is rated g and has nothing to offend or frighten anyone of any age . my son jeffrey , age 10 , gave the film  and remarked that it would be great for all ages . he couldn't think of anything he didn't like about it . on the edge of her seat through most of the picture , she stared in big-eyed delight at it .",SRh
"call it jurassic park jr . , although it's likely to appeal only to a small fraction of the audience that enjoyed steven spielberg's summer mega-hit . where that one was a thrill-a-minute ride filled with spectacular effects and well-orchestrated tension , we're back is an exercise in endurance--not only is it on the dull side , but it has such an overwhelming sense of sweetness that it threatens to become nauseating . it's adults accompanying their offspring who will have problems because , even considering the short length of the film , this is the visual equivalent of a sominex . to say that there's not much of interest going on is an understatement . while the plot is adequate for the under-ten group , it won't do much to satisfy the older viewer . hopefully we're back's single musical number , a nicely jaunty tune , is sufficient to keep the eyelids open . the premise is simple ( and simple-minded ) . with a talented writer like john patrick shanley ( moonstruck ) at the keyboard , i expected more than this trite , vacuous effort . sure , there's an occasional line thrown in for the adults , but that hardly makes the experience worthwhile . the best animated films are those that have something for viewers of all ages . over the years , disney's films have proven that "" animation "" doesn't equate with "" juvenile . "" the creators of we're back didn't learn the lesson , so their product turns out to be an overly-long , big screen cartoon . the animation is serviceable , and occasionally above-average . the limitations of a "" quickie job "" are often apparent , but there are a few nice sequences when it appears that some effort was put into the visual aspects of the story . whoever picked the voices for we're back made some unusual choices , none of which leads to an impressive or inspired performance . mr . cronkite gets an opportunity to say "" and that's the way it is . . .

"cast : richard dreyfuss , glenne headly , olympia dukakis , w . h . when the american president was released , many knowledgeable movie- goers commented how the sentimentality of its "" feel good "" storyline recalled the work of director frank capra . holland's opus , another capra-esque motion picture has reached today's theaters . similar in theme and content to dead poets' society and it's a wonderful life , this movie persuades its audience that no life spent in a worthy pursuit is ever wasted . unlike the american president , however , it doesn't stoop to heavy-handed proselytizing . and , while no one will accuse mr . holland's opus of getting its message across subtly , it's a more dramatically secure picture than rob reiner's -- when it manipulates , it does so skillfully . when lectures and text assignments don't fire his pupils' passion for the subject , glenn tries unique ways of encouraging an understanding that "" playing music is supposed to be fun -- it's about heart . . . not notes on a page . "" the musical metaphors in mr . holland's opus are rather obvious , and the soundtrack is an effective mix of pop tunes , classical compositions , and michael kamen's score . while no film this decade has equaled the accomplishment of krzysztof kieslowski and zbigniew preisner in wedding music and visuals for 1993's blue , mr . holland's opus has moments when it comes close . like it's a wonderful life , this movie is about appreciating the value of every person's effort to better the lives of others irrespective of the individual cost . dead poets' society told a similar story in a similar setting with similar themes , but mr . holland's opus has enough singular material to preserve its unique identity . those who prize the message and tone of those other pictures , however , will almost certainly enjoy this one . most of the time , when hollywood wants to show changes to a character over a significant span of time , a relatively young actor is used , and the aging process is accomplished via ( usually fake-looking ) makeup . for mr . holland's opus , the film makers tried the opposite , choosing a performer whose actual age closely matches the final age of the main character , then using makeup to rejuvenate him for the film's early sequences . surprisingly , the result doesn't excessively stretch credibility , although richard dreyfuss never looks thirty ( possibly forty ) . as always , the actor turns in a strong performance , regardless of how old mr . holland is supposed to be . in recent years , it has become common practice for movie studios to release at least one emotionally stirring drama around the holiday season . flaws aside , one common element in these films is that each focuses on the triumph of the human spirit , using a story that seeks to touch the heart . mr . it's a symphony of solid storytelling and good feeling that pays tribute to hollywood's rarely-seen , gentler side .",JBe
"something happens when innovative , independent directors "" go hollywood , "" and it's not usually a good something . some directors are ready-made for the pressures and compromises involved in working with big stars and big budgets ; others are so clearly out of their element that you can see them straining against the strictures of studio projects . sam raimi , director of the goofy and off-beat evil dead films , was hand-picked by sharon stone to helm the quick and the dead , and it looks like he had some interesting ideas about how to turn it inot a cock-eyed parody of spaghetti westerns . instead , it's not played with enough of a wink , and it becomes an extremely repetitive story muddled by tone shifts and unnecessary sub-plots . a few of the early gunfights are handled with typical raimi panache , including liberal use of the trackback/zoom in camera movement utilized by hitchcock and spielberg most notably . everywhere there are glimpses of raimi's twisted sense of humor , nowhere more so than in a gunfight which ends with the loser staring down at his shadow and noticing a hole in it . but that's all we get in the quick and the dead -- glimpses . where raimi wants self-awareness , screenwriter simon moore delivers a fairly standard western revenge saga . the story has potential , and particularly when a flashback reveals the source of ellen's grief there is evidence of some compelling psychological background . the relationship between cort and herod might have been exploited better , but for the most part cort is playing a part culled entirely from eastwood's penitent gunslingers in pale rider and unforgiven . and this is the real knock on the quick and the dead : without a real focus on raimi's satirical sensibilities and acrobatic camera tricks , it's just a less-than-mediocre knock-off of eastwood's oeuvre . gene hackman is a marvelous villain , oozing despicable charm , but his presence only magnifies the comparisons to unforgiven , and when he exposes a boastful gunman ( lance henriksen ) as a fraud , it sounds exactly like his debunking of english bob's self-aggrandizing tales in that earlier film . sharon stone is surprisingly effective as the haunted vengeance-seeker , but ultimately she too is lost in a story that doesn't really seem to have a sense of purpose . the quick and the dead boasts some fine cinematography by dante spinotti and a wonderfully dilapidated production design , and they could have been used in the service of a nice piece of parody . unfortunately , raimi couldn't or wouldn't let the throttle out , and the quick and the dead stalls when it's played far too straight .",SRe

"" we in the audience , having experienced many such movies before , know better . inventing the abbotts is a routine hollywood drama , which is to say that it doesn't take any chances and adheres rigorously to certain time- honored romantic conventions . the main story -- billy's relationship with pam -- is arguably the least interesting aspect of the film . in fact , the most compelling characters aren't necessarily the central figures . jennifer connelly's confident portrayal of eleanor crackles with open sexuality ; it's a shame that the film discards her so quickly . likewise , billy crudup's jacey is far more complex than his rather bland brother . watching inventing the abbotts is a comfortable experience . for the most part , the characters are effectively realized by a group of attractive young actors . writer ken hixon's screenplay , while not remarkable , includes a number of nice touches that keep us interested in the characters and involved in their lives . the broad strokes of the plot may be overused , but the emotions and details are on a higher level . the relationship between the brothers , which combines the right mix of friction and affection , is developed with enough depth to be convincing . inventing the abbotts would have been a better movie without the voiceover , a redundant and intrusive piece of prose that detracts from rather than adding to the story . like most voiceovers , this one greatly underestimates the intelligence of the audience . that particular narrative contrivance aside , however , inventing the abbotts comes across a genial , undemanding tale of love and life in the late '50s . and , while it's hard to get worked up about such a low-key motion picture , that doesn't diminish the simple enjoyment that the movie is capable of offering .",JBe
"the working title for no looking back was long time , nothing new , and rarely has there been a more apt name for a motion picture . even though this movie clocks in at a relatively skinny 96 minutes , it seems to run long enough to engulf two titanics . writer/director edward burns has trotted out a hackneyed storyline , the trajectory of which will be instantly recognizable to anyone who hasn't spent their life in seclusion . instead of tweaking the formula a little to invigorate the proceedings , burns is content to allow the film to ramble aimlessly towards its irritatingly predictable conclusion , offering precious few momentary pleasures along the way . no looking back is dominated by three very dislikable characters whose constant presence on the screen is painful . the most appropriate ending would have been a triple suicide , and the sooner , the better . alas , that's not the case , and those who stick with this film for its entire length will be forced to endure the prolonged company of this wretched trio . peeks of sunshine are few and far between . no wonder the characters are all so miserable . so who , if anyone , will claudia end up with ? no looking back goes to extraordinary lengths to make sure that we're not especially interested in the outcome of the romantic triangle . so what if no one finds happiness -- these characters don't deserve it anyway , especially after wasting 90 minutes of our time . they aren't real people -- they're a writer's construct stumbling through a too-obvious storyline . they should know the ending as well as we do . and burns should have given his audience more credit and presented them with a plot that at least offered a surprise or two . another frustrating thing about no looking back is that burns has populated the film with a group of potentially-interesting supporting characters . sadly , all we get is quick glimpses into their lives , although a movie about any of them would have been far more intriguing than the story burns has chosen to tell . none of the lead performers are going to wow critics with their thespian attributes . jon bon jovi shows more acting ability than one might reasonably expect from a singer branching into a different career , but he could still use a little polish . the worst case is lauren holly , who presents a completely bland claudia . as portrayed here , she's hardly the kind of woman who would inspire even a moment's interest , not to mention undying love . burns' ex , the monumentally untalented maxine bahns , would have been hard-pressed to do a less inspired job . some movie makers have only one good film in them .

"it's said that the worst thing for a parent is to watch the burial of their child . in rafal zielinski's insightful and unsettling fun , the premise is that two teenage girls meet , form an immediate friendship , and go in search of something "" important "" to share . although the different time frames are interleaved , there's little opportunity for confusion . not only do the different cinematographic styles separate time periods , they emphasize tone . there is no guilt or remorse . the killing -- a bloody , sadistic crime -- is shrugged off as just another way to enjoy life . it's the source of an adrenaline rush , a way to get high without drugs . it forges the kind of permanent bond in a new friendship that no mundane act can accomplish . hillary and bonnie's friendship is neither traditional nor healthy . the gradual development crucial to most relationships is bypassed . hillary and bonnie are no longer individuals -- they have acquired a single , psychotic identity . character development in fun is superior . not only does zielinski delve into the personalities of his protagonists , but he gives us random pieces of information to flesh out the less important characters . the counselor , for example , is not just a mouthpiece of judicial platitudes -- she's constantly fighting to overcome a misspent past . but , of course , everything comes back to hillary and bonnie , and the marvelous manner in which their characters are written and realized . these girls have deeply rooted problems . bonnie , with a wild , flamboyant personality that contrasts with her friend's introspective moodiness , is desperately in need of love , and will do or say anything to get it . obviously , there will be no academy awards for fun ; even if it had a u . s . distributor ( which it doesn't ) , this isn't the sort of movie to attract the necessary publicity . that said , however , alicia witt's remarkable performance is far better than that of most oscar winners . zielinski has a tremendous sense of mood and atmosphere , and he uses all the tools at his disposal to fashion the perfect tone . the camera work is impressive , and the choice of mixing color and black-and-white works to better effect here than in mrs . with themes and ideas in common with the likes of heavenly creatures , henry : portrait of a serial killer , natural born killers , and kieslowski's a short film about killing , fun is an example of a motion picture willing to tackle more than one thought-provoking concept . the intelligent , gripping result succeeds impressively , and presents a more complete and provocative portrait of relevant issues than any of those films . above all , however , fun gives us a chance to peer into the psyches of two memorable characters .",JBe

"love and other catastrophes is one of those movies that's so light and airy that's it's almost impossible to hate . unfortunately , it's also terribly predictable , which makes it difficult to like . in addition , the film tries so hard to be hip and trendy that at times it's almost painful . put that all together and what you get is a pleasant- but-dissatisfying motion picture that seems to be trying to copy cameron crowe's singles , but ends up a lot closer to ben stiller's reality bites . love and other catastrophes is the most recent in a veritable flood of comedies from australia . at least this one is a little different in temperament and style . for one thing , the soundtrack isn't saturated with '70s songs ( nothing by abba is even hinted at ) . secondly , few of the actors will look familiar . in fact , for many of them , like for director/co-writer emma-kate croghan , this is their first feature . love and other catastrophes falls into the category of the singularly unambitious romantic comedy . too many of the jokes fall flat , including brief jabs at the fanatical followers of directors quentin tarantino , woody allen , and spike lee . the film has a little fun equating the wisdom of philosophers like nietzche with that pop icons like john lennon , paul mccartney , and alfred hitchcock . perhaps the best line ( although not necessarily the most appropriate ) is a quote from the famous thriller director : "" always make the audience suffer as much as possible . "" for the most part , the fresh-faced actors , especially francis o'connor and alice garner , give likable performances . unfortunately , there isn't much romantic chemistry in evidence , although it's easy to envision all these characters as platonic friends . there's a simple playfulness about their relationships that's never effectively transformed into heat , even though we have a pretty good idea from the beginning who's going to be paired up with whom . the best part of love and other catastrophes has nothing to do with romance or relationships . this sequence is about the only spontaneous-seeming aspect of the film ; the rest of love and other catastrophes is at least a notch below it . i suppose croghan thought she was bringing something new to the screen with love and other catastrophes , although i can't imagine what . admittedly , this is the first generation x comedy that i can recall being photographed through an amber filter , but i don't think that's what the director had in mind for her hallmark achievement . unfortunately , that's one of the most memorable aspects of this unremarkable film . love and other catastrophes isn't funny enough , romantic enough , or offbeat enough to distinguish itself from the many films it's in direct competition with .",JBe
"a dull and oppressingly long three-hour ode to the glory of war and killing . this strictly commercial film's budget was for $135 million and uses as its model for financial success "" titanic "" and its anti-historical way of telling its historical story . it's a film made for the huge crowds it hopes to pull in , by giving them all the goo they could possibly ingest in one sitting . it ran a clich ? romance story for two hours worth of the film and after 80 minutes of this corny love story , the japanese at last attack pearl harbor and the film to its credit accurately gets the chaos of the events right ( the only thing it got right in the film ) . this invasion was the heart of the film and lasted for about 40 minutes ; it got its money's worth in good airplane battle footage from the computer-generated imagery ( though the scene itself had a flatness that made it appear uninvolving but competenly done ; there was no emotional resonance to any of the action ; it was respected for its technical achievement rather than for being artistic ) . for the last third of the film you could have skipped out and missed nothing , because it went back to that annoying love story it was hammering out . every thing about this film was second rate ; especially , when compared to modern war films such as "" saving private ryan . "" the trite dialogue , inept script , misuse of history , irritating character portrayals , the soapy background music , and the clanky acting by everyone concerned , made this overlong work into a critical bomb . every character was a stock character seen in many other hollywood films . i couldn't help myself from laughing , it was such a silly attempt at patriotism . that's about as deep as we get into their characters . kate has fine features and virtuous good looks , and an empty expression that is the same both for love of rafe and of country . the film plays it safe and lays no blame on why pearl harbor was so unprotected . no character in the film had any shading or depth , everyone was a forgettable personality . the one-dimensional characters just say their lines and the film keeps moving along . though this film failed in every which way to provide a history lesson , or an engaging story , or be an entertaining film ; still i'm afraid it will have box-office success . it reduced everything to the lowest commom denominator by the crass bruckheimer rules for commercial success ( keep the dialogue banal and down to the film's theme , and keep everything in motion so no ideas could get in the way of the mindless violence on the screen ; this way it remains on a fourth grade level and can be easily understood by the masses ) . it would be difficult to make a film more shallow than this one ; but , i'm cynically looking forward to bay and bruckheimer teaming up again , i think they have the potential to stoop lower than they have so far ( because as bad as this film was , it could have been worst ) .",DSc

"screenplay : malcolm bradbury . director : john schlesinger . cold comfort farm is directed with such sparkle and confidence that i almost couldn't believe john schlesinger was behind the camera . . . at least not the john schlesinger whose recent contributions to the cinematic canon were suspense misfires like pacific heights , the innocent and eye for an eye . even in his glory days of midnight cowboy , the day of the locust and marathon man , one would hardly say that "" light-hearted "" was an adjective applicable to his work . yet here we find schlesinger tackling the much-beloved stella gibbons novel , a parody with a giddy and irreverent tone , and nailing it . cold comfort farm is thoroughly entertaining and consistently surprising . a literary satire is a real challenge to film -- it's like trying to pull the humor out of that annual contest to duplicate hemingway's prose style and put it on screen -- but screenwriter malcolm bradbury has come up with the clever premise of following flora's budding writing career . grasping at the perfect metaphor for a sunset ( she can never quite figure out what "" the golden orb "" is supposed to do ) over her open d . h . lawrence novels , flora allows us a bit of insight into the florid writing gibbons was winking at . but cold comfort farm is even more successful at turning the conventions of those genres' plots upside down . those secrets turn out to be red herrings ; it doesn't matter _what_ they are , only that everyone at cold comfort farm is living under the weight of those long-past events , waiting for someone like flora to come along and push each of them in the direction of the one thing that will make them genuinely excited . the result is some hilarious moments and sharp performances , as we watch amos improvising a sermon before his church of ( literally ) quivering brethren , and seth grabbing his chance at big-screen stardom , and the characters are rendered with a refreshing lack of concern over whether they are being condescended to . that is a criticism some detractors have leveled against cold comfort farm , and i think they are missing the point . but schlesinger and bradbury show gibbons' characters with an eye to the basic desire for happiness which flora is trying to uncover . flora brings a breath of life to cold comfort farm , and schlesinger's cold comfort farm brings a breath of life to a decidedly musty film season .",SRe

"farewell my concubine , director chen kaige's 1992 epic drama , told a tale about sex and friendship against a turbulent political backdrop . temptress moon , the film maker's 1996 followup ( which premiered with much hoopla at that year's cannes film festival ) has similar intentions , but less successful results . rather than existing as a deeply-moving exploration of characters and relationships , temptress moon plunges into a sudsy , melodramatic formula that it never quite manages to escape from . the film boasts many interesting elements , but , in comparison to concubine , it's a disappointing effort . we are introduced to the three main characters -- zhongliang , ruyi , and duanwu -- as children , before the film skips forward in time to the 1920s . chen's story is interesting , but not ground-breaking , and it lacks the multi-layered depth of his previous effort . at its heart , temptress moon is about the war between the sexes at a time when women's equality was a phrase rarely uttered within china's borders . it's fascinating to watch the intricate dance that these three go through as they fight to emerge unscathed , and to recognize that love not only complicates the battle , but raises the stakes . the political climate of the 1920s serves as the film's background rather than an integral part of the proceedings -- the story could have been moved forward or backward in time without many changes . however , since the period details are among temptress moon's strengths , such an adjustment would have deprived audiences of some impressive visual elements . chen's 1920s atmosphere is strongest at a train station and on city streets , but its influence pervades the entire picture . regardless of its other flaws , this , like many chinese motion pictures , is visually sumptuous . the acting of the leads is nearly flawless . many of their scenes sizzle and one in particular -- a confrontation in shanghai when ruyi demands to know if zhongliang loves her -- is charged with emotional power . kevin lin is equally good in a role that demands more subtlety . duanwu's participation in the war of the sexes is less obvious than that of the other two , but critical to the outcome . temptress moon requires concentration , especially at the beginning , because , as scenes change and the story makes occasionally-jarring chronological jumps , it's easy to lose track of who the characters are and how they relate to each other . miramax has attempted to ease the burden by supplying descriptive subtitles , but it's only a minor aid . it's curious that the two latest chinese films to feature gangsters ( this and zhang yimou's shanghai triad ) are among the weakest recent cinematic exports from those shores . perhaps the film makers are so concerned with capturing the mystique of the era that they lose sight of the deeper thematic and plot-related elements that have made movies like farewell my concubine and raise the red lantern modern classics . but , although temptress moon falls short of the lofty perch upon which those pictures reside , there's still something compelling about the rhythm of this film , and the ending has its own brand of power . temptress moon is a flawed motion picture , but still makes for worthwhile viewing .",JBe
"date released : 12/22/93 ( ny , la ) ; 1/14/94 ( elsewhere ) running length : 2 : 05 rated : pg-13 ( mature themes , language , brief nudity ) some will argue that a film , being essentially a means of entertainment , can do little to change a national consciousness . others , citing the power of the medium , will claim that motion pictures possess this rare and extraordinary ability . these two opposing viewpoints are about to be put to the test with two films that , while different in so many ways , have a number of fundamental similarities . the first is steven spielberg's schindler's list . for viewers of the latter movie , the question is not whether they sympathize with tom hanks' aids-afflicted , gay character , but whether that sympathy opens up a different perspective on the victims of the disease in the real world . the point has been made numerous times that this is the first "" big name , big budget "" aids motion picture to come out of hollywood , so i won't belabor the point . it's a good start , and some might argue "" too little , too late , "" but for there to be any hope of this industry having an impact , more films of this caliber must be released . philadelphia is unlikely to succeed as a lone cry in the wilderness , however impressive it may be . tom hanks gives what has rightly been called "" the performance of his career , "" lending humanity and vibrancy to the victim , and portraying him in a manner that eschews maudlin , obvious tactics to garner the audience's sympathy . we feel for andrew beckett because he seems to be a genuine human being , not because the script and production have twisted circumstances to manipulate our emotions . with all of the plaudits garnered by hanks , the work of denzel washington , while less obvious , is as impressive . washington plays the "" everyman , "" the on-screen representation of those in the audience who harbor homophobic tendencies . he , like many viewers , is forced to examine his bigotry , and reassess his feelings about the gay community , as he comes to know them as people rather than symbols and caricatures . its also ironic that most of philadelphia's humor comes through washington , the recognized dramatic actor ( as he passes out business cards ) , rather than through hanks , known better for comic roles . curiously , jason robards has one of the worst-acted and the best-acted scenes in the film . the entire speech rings false , like something out of an anti-homosexual pamphlet . this scene is philadelphia's watershed . unfortunately , there are too few of these moments , with an inordinate amount of time spent in front of the judge . philadelphia doesn't work well as a courtroom drama--some of the scenes are necessary to underline certain points , but they go on too long . more character development , especially involving the complex relationship between beckett and miller , would have elevated the picture's power . symbolism is crucial to the story ; the most obvious example is the role of physical space between beckett and miller . philadelphia was originally the movie's working name , but demme stated that once he saw the preliminary cut , he couldn't think of a better final title . even as it stands , with its faults , philadelphia is still a remarkable expression of honesty and openness . miller's court statements about this country's fear of homosexuals are frank and to-the-point , and there are other observations with equal merit . the story is timely and powerful , and the performances of hanks and washington assure that the characters will not immediately vanish into obscurity . and as long as people remember , there's a chance they can change .",JBe

"the two main characters in neil labute's in the company of men -- the best american film to appear this year , and the best film _likely_ to appear -- do some of the most vicious things screen characters have ever done without weapons . you may walk into in the company of men expecting it to be about the cruelty of men towards women . you'll walk out realizing it is about cruelty in every possible permutation . it is a testimony to labute's talent as a storyteller that he allows us to see the damaged humanity beneath the despicable things his characters do . matt malloy's howard , who seems to be the kinder of the two , simply has a more benign pathology . then there is chad , a startling creation rendered with creepy nonchalance and savage humor by aaron eckhart . it would be easy to read chad as a simple sociopath ; it would also be the least interesting reading . his every action is a pre-emptive first strike of rage -- at women , at his co-workers , at the world -- designed to keep everyone off-balance through the bald-faced exertion of power . labute employs notably static composition throughout in the company of men , the kind which might be written off as the work of a rookie film-maker who hasn't discovered his visual style . i can't imagine a more fitting style for this story . for all their barely-diluted bile , chad and howard are essentially creations of their world , a corporate culture of claustrophobic cubicles , water cooler back-stabbing and mundane line-ups at the copy machine . labute's shots cage his performers , observing their panicked movements from a distance as though they were zoo animals . there is no room for morality in the company of men ; the concept is a luxury for those who still feel human . in the company of men is caustic enough that it's not always a pleasant experience , but it's hardly like taking medicine , either . labute's brilliant script and eckhart's star-making performance as chad create some of the year's most hilarious moments , even if the laughter is born of disbelief as frequently as delight . in fact , chad is so charming that there is bound to be consternation over his portrayal , concern that he could be viewed as a cutthroat role model . how sad if there were even a glimmer of truth to such perceptions . neil labute has unveiled the horror of an environment of gross selfishness turned toxic -- it's objectivism rendered as psychosis . watching in the company of men is like watching a car wreck between ethics and primal urges , one from which it's almost impossible to look away . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line "" subscribe "" .",SRe
"screenplay : becky johnston , based on the memoir by heinrich harrer . director : jean-jacques annaud . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( adult themes , violence , profanity ) running time : 137 minutes . if you accept hollywood's version of things , history -- particularly the uglier parts of history -- is what happens while white people are watching . it's not terribly surprising , since studios generally balk at anything remotely depressing ; fears can be allayed if an established anglo actor anchors such projects . so we end up with revolution in south america through the eyes of james woods in salvador , the plight of native americans as seen by kevin costner in dances with wolves , upheaval in burma as it affects patricia arquette in beyond rangoon . . . not one of them a terrible film , but each one compromised by the sense that we couldn't be trusted to identify with a dark face . in fact , these stories aren't even about the culture involved . there is a lot to like about individual moments , technical skill and overall atmosphere in seven years in tibet . an early mountain-climbing sequence is tense and restrained , the location photography is spectacular , and the performances of thewlis and wangchuk ( enchanting as the wise yet playful dalai lama ) are solid and appealing . the relationship between heinrich and the dalai lama is the most effective element in the film , smartly rendered by becky johnston's script . it takes a while for seven years to reach that relationship , but it's well-developed once it becomes the film's focus . it's often hard to see that focus , however , because seven years in tibet is an epic which feels like it's rushing frantically from place to place . there's a lot of ground to cover in harrer's story , probably more than 135 minutes can cover , but that's all we get . rather than finding the solid narrative through-line and sticking with it , the script hunts and pecks for dramatic events over a decade of time . of course , seven years' narrative through-line is the emotional and spiritual growth of harrer , so it's hard to say whether that would have been an improvement . it's not that pitt does a bad job as harrer , though his austrian accent wanders from here to there . in fact , he does a fine job of making harrer more than just a cocky rascal ; he's thoroughly self-absorbed to the point of needing a good spanking . but pitt could give the performance of a lifetime , and we'd still be left with a film which doesn't seem to have its priorities straight . it's true that even a sweeping story needs a protagonist to give broad-scale suffering a human face , but that face doesn't have to be topped by a head of blond hair . if seven years in tibet had not attempted to be more than the biography of an interesting man , i might have enjoyed it much more . instead , its attempts to be a "" message "" film end up delivering the wrong messages . while the chinese conquest of tibet warrants about five minutes of screen time in seven years in tibet , harrer's project building a movie theater for the dalai lama gets twice that . it's ironic , in a way : even within the film , the media of the west threaten to overwhelm another culture . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line "" subscribe "" .",SRe

"eye of god is the evocative title given by writer/director tim blake nelson to the film adaptation of his stage play . the resulting examination of characters and issues is expressed as a noir thriller . the blood isn't tommy's , but it's clear that he has either witnessed or committed a terrible crime . as a result , ainsley becomes the kind of real person that an audience can understand and sympathize with . kevin anderson is also effective , although his role is somewhat less original and ambitious . the fundamentalist "" villain "" has become too much of a cliche over the years -- an easy target for film makers to take aim at . it's at the point now where if there's a fervently religious character in a movie , he or she will inevitably turn out to be a psycho . the themes that form eye of god's backbone are questions that have troubled humankind since the dawn of history : is there a god ? however , while these are fascinating questions , the perfunctory manner in which nelson presents them doesn't do them justice . one scene in particular -- two characters sitting together gazing out across a darkened lake -- illustrates the gap between the film maker's intentions and the viewer's reaction . it's a reflective , melancholy moment , but lacks the profound spiritual texture that nelson ascribes to it . as a philosophical excursion , eye of god falls short of the greatness to which it aspires . its success comes through the manner in which it captures the day-to-day , mundane aspects of the human experience . since pulp fiction , non-chronological storytelling has become popular . many movies take this approach out of the belief that it will make them appear more cutting-edge , when , in reality , it often results in needless confusion and frustration on the viewer's part . while this approach diffuses some of the film's mystery potential , it replaces it with a different dynamic that retains our interest . eye of god belongs in the same category as films like fargo and sling blade -- it's the latest of many entries into the suddenly hot , so-called "" southern gothic "" genre . yet , because of its structure and the somewhat oblique manner in which it approaches its quietly appealing lead character , this is a different shade of noir . nelson's approach to this material is ambitious , and , although he doesn't quite realize everything he hopes to , there's enough here to make eye of god worth a look when it's released commercially in the fall of 1997 .",JBe
"every summer movie season has its blockbuster duds ; surprise hits ; and dull , brainless , formula "" family films "" guaranteed to fall between the cracks . life with mikey belongs firmly in the third category . this is a vapid film , with little to recommend it save its lack of anything offensive . the draw is that parents can take their offspring to the theater without fear of hearing a string of profanity , seeing someone get shot or mauled , or being bombarded by half-naked women running across the screen . unfortunately , such "" wholesomeness "" is not nearly enough reason to spend money and time on life with mikey . actually , this looks more like a made-for-tv movie than something developed for theatrical release ( although , from the start , it was always intended for the big screen ) . the production quality is low and the script a product of the plot-by-numbers division of hollywood . little more intelligence has been put into the main story than was included in the intentionally-awful clips we see from life with mikey . something interesting in the premise got lost in the movie's transition from an idea to the final product . this is the umpteenth movie in which the child melts the heart of a cynical adult while the adult shows her/him that someone cares . it's a tale that hollywood has done to death , and this movie has nothing to add to it . one of the few surprises about life with mikey is the movie's lack of energy . caused by a combination of "" mail-in-the-performance "" acting , poor directing , a routine music score ( by alan menken , who seems to get worse with every soundtrack ) , and pedestrian camerawork , the sense of lethargy pervades every scene , threatening to lull the unsuspecting viewer to sleep . there are a couple of funny moments , but they neither last long nor are they memorable enough to recall after the final credits roll . not so in life with mikey . perhaps he's trying to parody himself as an ex-young tv star , but his character comes across as completely unconvincing . christina vidal , a newcomer , supplies the only brief bursts of liveliness available in this otherwise-stagnant picture , but she still has a lot of rough edges . too often , it's plain that she's acting . life with mikey is a subpar piece of film making for which the producers' intentions are all-too-apparent . considering the creative limitations of this project , such blatant marketing is patently offensive . those with a yen to see something for the whole family can find hundreds of better offerings on video , and fans of michael j . fox would do better to peruse old episodes of family ties .",JBe
"what happens when you have low-budget , low-profile motion picture that turns into an unexpected smash hit ? you make a sequel , of course . and , as proven by sister act 2 , as long as you have the star of the original , there's absolutely no need to concern yourself with little details like plot , characterization , or acting . if there's one thing that sister act 2 does , it makes the viewer appreciate the first installment of the series . during the course of this film , i found myself longing for the original--and that's especially surprising because i wasn't fond of it . nevertheless , chapter one had quite a bit more going for it than this sorry excuse for a sequel . sister act was occasionally enjoyable because of the freshness and energy with which the pop-turned-gospel songs were performed . in fact , most of the fifties and sixties songs have been replaced by rap numbers , and i can assure you that the technique doesn't work nearly as well . how many people really want to hear a rap version of "" joyful , joyful "" ? if it weren't such a pleasure to see these two , they might just as easily have been altogether eliminated . of course , whoopi goldberg has also returned , but the less said about her so-called performance , the better . the newcomers to sister act 2 don't do much for the movie . michael jeter , who plays a franciscan father , isn't especially funny or entertaining ( except during the previously-mentioned closing number , which is better by far than anything in the one-hundred minutes that precede it ) , and i'm still having trouble figuring out why james coburn was given a part . it's kind of frightening that it took three writers to come up with this "" plot .

"starring : daniel day-lewis , michelle pfeiffer , winona ryder . screenplay : jay cocks and martin scorsese . director : martin scorsese . viewers of the age of innocence will likely fall into one of two camps : those who consider it a minor masterpiece , and those who consider it a huge bore . there is something to be said for both sides . director martin scorsese has crafted a sumptuous and dazzling visual feast from edith wharton's novel of social propriety and repressed desire , but one that suffers from an overlong second act and a lack of character depth . while still an exceptional film experience , it is ultimately one which i found much more engaging intellectually than emotionally . the age of innocence is a tale of surfaces , of a society concerned with the appearance of things rather than the reality . scorsese captures this obsession with surfaces by letting his camera dwell on things rather than people ; calling cards , watch fobs , earrings and table settings all become icons of status and civility . it's a fascinating anthropological study , highlighted by typically bravura scorsese moments , including a piercingly insightful tour through one house during a formal ball . yet for all its virtuosity , i found the age of innocence working essentially as a documentary , not the forbidden love story which is at its core . scorsese is so good at establishing the framework , that he has little time left for the characters . they are kept at a distance , which may in part be the point but left me a bit cold . the performers are not to be held responsible for these shortcomings . he carries himself as though he is constantly on the brink of exploding but knows that it is impossible to do so . miriam margolyes is delightful as may's eccentric and knowing granny mingott , but the rest of the cast is forced to do what it can with roles which essentially function as archer's obstacles ; they are not really characters in their own right . however , the film's technical credits alone make it required viewing . longtime scorsese collaborator thelma schoonmaker does a glorious editing job , and even gets her name on a billboard in the film . cinematographer michael ballhaus takes some stunning and instantly memorable shots , including an ocean panorama which looks like a painting . elmer bernstein's score is lush and evocative , and the costume and production design are certain oscar nominees . the age of innocence demonstrates yet again that martin scorsese could direct "" dick and jane "" into a visual spectacle . it's a fascinating examination of lifeless and soulless time , and my attention never waned . but i kept finding myself oddly detached , wanting to care more about whether or not archer and ellen would find happiness together but never quite able to do so . there is so much to admire about the age of innocence that it seems like nitpicking , but i'm funny that way : i want to be caught up in love stories .",SRe
"screenplay : warren beatty and robert towne . making an old-fashioned romance isn't as easy as it might look . while films from this year like it could happen to you and only you attempted to re-create the magic of bygone love stories , they succeeded primarily in creating cloying pseudo-parodies of what those classic stories were all about : that perfect someone appearing at the most improbable--and inconvenient--time . love affair does it right . warren beatty and annette bening have taken this third telling of a tear-jerking classic and made it a warm , sentimental and beautifully filmed experience , limited in its effectiveness only by beatty's somewhat wooden lead performance . if there is one unquestionable triumph to love affair , it is the atmosphere . there is a lyricism to his direction , without the force qualities of other recent romances . cinematographer conrad l . hall shoots in deep oranges and with lots of filters , and photographs bening in the loving style which used to be reserved for grace kelly or ingrid bergman . ennio morricone's sweet , simple score also contributes to a mood which inspires you to hold your date's hand a bit more tightly . this is not to say that love affair gets by on style points alone . at the top of the list is bening , beatty's real life better half , who shines as terry . few actresses in film can manage the kind of mature , intelligent appeal she brings to her roles , which makes it a shame that her appearances have been so infrequent of late . here she is both savvy and vulnerable , more than a match for beatty's aging playboy but still harboring basic insecurities . it's not a flashy role--love affair is not a flashy movie--but it's a fine performance . garry shandling is a delight as kip , mike gambril's agent , toning down his usual neurotic persona and giving a witty reading , and harold ramis has a funny cameo as an acerbic accountant . it's one of love affair's most significant failings that that same scene does more to explain beatty's character than beatty himself manages to do . this could have proved to be a fatal flaw , but there is just enough inherent romance in the situation that their pairing doesn't seem completely implausible . but the cathartic final scene is effective enough to make up for the melancholy tone of the final half hour . sentimentality is frequently a tough sell . love affair may be schmaltz , but it is artfully executed and well-acted schmaltz . and it renews my faith that somewhere , someone knows how to make a real love story .",SRe

"unfortunately , as a story , it flags much more often than it inspires . although it hits many of the highlights of recent tibetan history , the vacuousness of becky johnston's script , based on heinrich harrer's autobiographical book , leaves one strangely unmoved . in good hollywood fashion , the movie has a twin so perhaps the other tibetan film this year will prove to have more substance . with a sometimes all too cute austrian accent , he delivers as much as can be expected in such an underdeveloped and overlong production . david thewlis from black beauty plays peter with precision but little emotion . the genuinely harrowing visuals of their climbs provide the few completely captivating moments of the film . as an apolitical figure , heinrich is non-plussed . "" i have nothing to do with your silly war , "" he tells his captors . these excessively cute scenes dominate the story's latter half , and the almost total destruction of tibet seems , in contrast , almost tacked on as an afterthought . except for the mountain climbing sequences , french director jean-jacques annaud ( the bear ) has as much trouble with the action sequences as the more intimate moments . the film's few minutes of war footage are filmed by robert fraisse in a blur with the rapid pans of a purposely shaky , handheld camera . the effect of this choreography leaves the audience more confused than moved . most movies have a part where suspension of disbelief is essential . the story is not without its humor as when the workers stop construction of the dalai lama's movie palace .

"watching the cell is akin to watching a demo reel for the film's art directors , makeup artists , production designer and costume designer -- which , i'm sure , it will end up being . make no mistake about it , the cell is the kind of film technical craftspeople lie awake fantasizing about . the result can be the eye-popping stuff of oscar nominations ( and wins ) , a film people walk away from thinking what all art directors , makeup artists , production designers and costume designers secretly want viewers to walk away thinking : "" boy , that looked incredible .

"this is the director akira kurosawa's international breakthrough film , garnering many awards , including hollywood's 1952 best foreign language film oscar and the golden lion award , at the 1951 venice film festival . rashomon became incorporated into the everyday language , and japanese films became a regular part of the western world's film culture mainly because of this film . the strength of the film lies in its attempt to show how the search for the truth is laden with traps , as all four narrators of the horrid event depicted are supposedly telling the truth according to what they believe they saw but their truths still turn out to be veiled in mystery . in the intellectual scheme of this puzzler , kurosawa determines that the truth cannot be found because 'the truth is relative . ' the film is blemished only by kurosawa's backtracking at the conclusion , coming up with an unconvincing and hokey humanistic ending to counter his more potent argument that everyone lies for selfish reasons . what makes the film special besides its interesting philosophical theme , is the high-powered performances , especially the one by toshiro mifune as the manic bandit tajomaru , and in the frenetic movements of the camera ( whether slow or fast paced ) and the way it captured the intensity of the film , giving it its sense of urgency . this was a unique filming device used by kurosawa , of zooming in on the character when telling his or her version , as each had a different rhythm that the camera underscored by revealing the particular mood of the storyteller . the common man is not surprised that mankind is selfish , as he takes a cynical view of humanity , anyway , listening to the story as if it's just a typical murder one . the woman's version is quite different , as each narrator tells a version that makes them look good . there was no duel . she asks the court , what should a poor , defenseless woman like me do ? he says he almost forgave the bandit for acting honorable at that point . all three participants are shown to have poor character . the truth is subjective and can't be believed in its entirety because of each narrator's ego . this contrived ending is supposed to show that there are still those who will unselfishly reach out to help others . the film has not aged that well , though it seems to still be a powerful picture but , in my opinion , not the masterpiece it was once thought of . i think the same reevaluation will take place of kurosawa's long and distinguished career and he will be downgraded from being crowned as a great director to a very good one . he seems to suffer in most of his films from too much sentimentality and contrivances , though his strong filming techniques and very muscular camera work , as exhibited in this film , will remain his ultimate trademark .",DSc

"screenplay : susannah grant . director : steven soderbergh . mpaa rating : r ( profanity , adult themes ) running time : 133 minutes . steven soderbergh has fashioned one of those careers that movie people always claim they want . he gets to make unconventional , experimental films like kafka , schizopolis and the limey , while still making a few bucks doing "" mainstream "" films like king of the hill and out of sight . yet "" mainstream "" truly belongs in quotes where soderbergh is concerned , since his approach to timeworn genres is as unconventional and his conventionally unconventional work . despite his popularity with the art house set , he has found it difficult to cross over to a broader audience , since he keeps baffling that audience by taking amiable entertainments and putting meat on their bones . you might think you know what to expect from a coming-of-age story or a crime caper , but did you really expect what soderbergh delivered in king of the hill and out of sight ? erin brockovich is another film -- a legal crowd-pleaser with a tart-tongued heroine -- that looks like you should know what to expect . leave it to soderbergh to make even that kind of you-go-girl hollywood premise uniquely appealing . in most films of this kind , you would expect a combination of sassy one-liners and courtroom theatrics . you do get some of the former -- courtesy a solid susannah grant script that gives roberts plenty of no-nonsense dialogue to bite into -- but there's a way roberts plays a line that keeps the film from degenerating into mundanely rabble-rousing chick flickery . roberts has her detractors , particularly when it comes to her dramatic performances , yet erin brockovich finds her effectively taming the glamour girl looks into a convincing character . even when she's snapping off one of erin's saltier tirades against the lack of recognition she's getting , roberts never seems to be waiting for a laugh . she does one of the hardest things anyone can do with a character like this : she refuses to play erin with a wink to the audience so we all know it's julia roberts beneath the bitter exterior . you also have to give soderbergh his share of the credit for knowing how erin needed to be played , but it's no surprise to find him in control of his material . in keeping with the less-than-sexy title of the film , soderbergh makes sure the case never overwhelms the character . while the lawsuit against pacific gas & electric makes for compelling drama , it's not as compelling as erin navigating the path towards self-respect . the story features elements familiar from a hundred legal investigation dramas in the grisham era -- the nasty corporate monolith , gutsy underdogs , saintly victims , etc . -- but erin brockovich always seems to find an unexpected angle just when it's most necessary . erin brockovich does take its conventional turns , and -- not coincidentally -- that's usually when it starts to meander . erin's romance with a soft-hearted biker named george ( aaron eckhart ) leads to a trite "" you care about your job more than your family "" confrontation ( think sissy spacek's whine in jfk with a little gender role reversal ) , and there's one moment of precocious sensitivity by erin's son matthew ( scotty leavenworth ) that almost makes you want to shudder . still , soderbergh and roberts bring too much crackling originality to erin brockovich for its study of character through hard work to suffer too much . i'm not sure steven soderbergh's erin brockovich will set audiences to applauding as they leave the theater . that would happen in another director's version , one where the predictable doesn't have a way of turning into the unpredictable . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .",SRe
"1993 has been quite a year for films with chinese and chinese-american themes . now comes cannes film festival palme d'or co-winner farewell my concubine , and it becomes clear that everything else was just a warm-up . director chen kaige has fashioned a drama mesmerizing from first frame to last , and does so without getting artsy or obscure . this is a remarkably accessible epic , and the best film of this year in any language . as adults , the two become the most renowned opera stars in beijing , and adopt new stage names . perhaps the most astonishing thing about farewell is that in spite of its scope , it's really a very simple , old-fashioned love triangle which happens to be about a man and a woman both in love with the same man . the three principals are bold and dynamic characters , each of whom never does exactly what is expected . rather , he treats dieyi more or less as nothing but a co-worker , a man whom he likes and even needs for his career , but doesn't really respect . then there is juxian , perhaps the strongest character emotionally , self-assured to a fault in male-dominated china and capable in that confidence of surprising displays of forgiveness . her conflict with dieyi powers farewell's most haunting moments . chen kaige's direction demonstrates a mastery of composition and narrative structure rarely seen . the opening sequence , a reunion between dieyi and xiaolou which frames the flashbacks to come , is a triumph of lighting and texture . chen crafts brilliant cuts , such as a cut from xiaolou's announcement of his engagement to juxian , and his request for dieyi "" to be my best man , "" to a full screen closeup of dieyi , still in his concubine makeup and looking not like a "" best man "" but a rejected woman . every shot is a minor revelation , raising chen to the level of one of modern cinema's true masters . no amount of hyperbole will get some filmgoers to see a 2 1/2 hour story with subtitles about marginalized characters . i can't think of a greater artistic tragedy . farewell my concubine is a thrilling love story , a political epic and an intimate character study rolled into one stunning package . if you've never seen a non-english language film before , find this one . it's just that good .",SRe

"" the speech felt like it was lifted straight from hugh grant's wedding speech in four weddings and a funeral . this is one derivative show from beginning to end . well , many of them are replayed here , but not as well . the problem with the pallbearer has nothing to do with the casting or the acting . most of the acting , with the exception of the poor performance by hershey , is fine . the show is kept at the superficial level . there is not a character that is real or that you care about . now , strictly as escapist entertainment , it almost works . certainly there are many big laughs in the show , but i left the movie feeling a bit cheated and unsatisfied . the film just does not realize its potential . the pallbearer runs too long at 1 : 46 . it is rated pg-13 , but it is a mild pg-13 . there is no sex , nudity , or violence , and the language is pretty tame . it would be fine for kids over 9 although i suspect , given the subject matter , it might be more appropriate for those over 12 . several big laughs were not enough to get me to recommend this retread , but i am giving it  for the laughs and for david schwimmer's performance .",SRh
"there's very little that's right about this sudsy melodrama , and a great deal that's shockingly wrong . in fact , it would be an insult to romantic drivel to use that appellation for swept from the sea . instead , this is something far less satisfying . the movie tries mightily to touch our hearts with its mixture of comedy and tragedy . problem #1 : the comic moments are so awkward that they're more likely to cause winces than laughs . problem #2 : the tragic scenes are so overplayed that they appear like clinics of bad acting . problem #3 : the script is so insipid that it's impossible to become involved enough with these characters to care one way or another what happens to them . occasionally , depending on the nature of the story , this approach can be quite effective , but here , as is too often the case , it's used simply to facilitate a voice-over ( known by another name as "" the writer's crutch "" ) . this is an example of laziness on the part of kidron and writer tim willocks , who found it easier to have ian mckellan talk about details rather than going to the trouble of actually showing them . unable to understand yanko's language , the villagers shun him -- all except amy and a few others . as poorly-written as the script and dialogue are , things aren't helped by the wooden performances of the leads . on the other hand , i was reasonably impressed by rachel weisz in stealing beauty ; her bland , expressionless portrayal here comes as an unpleasant surprise . the supporting performers -- ian mckellan as a helpful doctor , joss ackland as a local landowner , and kathy bates as his daughter -- are equally lifeless and uninspired . taken as a whole , swept from the sea is a mess . it seems to run on forever , and the pretty scenery and john barry's operatic score do little to moderate the boredom . the bad movies that are the least fun to watch are usually those that aspire to some level of artistic pretentiousness . but , in aiming to attract the sophisticated movie-goer , who will easily see through the stylistic posturing , the film makers have virtually assured that their product will have not audience . considering the movie's lack of quality , that's not a bad thing .

"o brother , where art thou ? , an adaptation of homer's classic tale , "" the odyssey , "" is by none other than the coen brothers , joel and ethan . you know , the ones who brought us the big lebowski and fargo . don't worry , there aren't any subtitles , and the adaptation is loose , very loose . set during the depression , the film's imaginative cinematography looks like a print left out to bake in the hot mississippi sun , which makes the heat palpable . the cat-and-mouse story meanders like a leaf drifting lazily on a stagnant pond . this gives you reason to look for the music video and the cd of the soundtrack . it doesn't , however , provide you enough reason to see the picture , which lacks one essential ingredient , humor . this is a comedy in which i didn't laugh once nor did those around me . the coen brothers are brilliant visual stylists , which they amply demonstrated in fargo and do so again in this film . many scenes give you much to admire , even if not much to like .

"it is an elegantly sentimental work touching on the rituals observed on an army post . those were indeed more simplistic times , but not totally out of the realm of how some modern day soldiers may feel . the twists in the story line come from the quirks the characters display not from the story itself , which is rather ordinary : the comraderie between the captain and the very irish top sergeant ( mclaglen ) , who likes a bit of whiskey and adds comic relief to the stodginess of the army routine , fits in with the buddy theme of many ford films . a virtue that is considered essential for any character in a ford movie , that he really cares about . it adds to the feeling that the past cannot be ignored . winton hoch , the cinematographer , won an oscar for the visually memorable mesas and haunting loneliness of the monument valley landscape , which was used as the film's location sites . it provides the film with an epic scale of the country , as there is a melancholy intermingled in those vistas with a sense of reverie for the men who are so far away from civilization , surrounded by the red sand and barren mountain peaks , yet are greater practitioners of civilized etiquettes than even the citizens back east , through their daily obediance to rank and order and their need to socialize by formal dance and their chilvary toward women , which might seem old-fashioned but is pleasantly accomplished here . what pulls the film together and gives it a raw power , is something that can only be ascertained by accepting ford's premise that it is absolutely necessary what the men do and that they are in the right . to scrutinize this film in any other way , is to lose track of what direction the film meant to be going . to add color and more sentimentality to the story , there is the theme song of the yellow ribbon , played countless times , either to the immense pleasure of most viewers or to some , to grate on their nerves . the calvary should follow them to their reservations , but stay out of sight so the indians wouldn't be humiliated by the men watching them . this is ford's look at the west and the cavalry men he adores so much . perhaps the scene that summarizes the film's intentions best , is when wayne is given a solid silver watch by the men for his retirement , and the presenting of the gift and the accepting of it , are met with a few well-chosen words , each weighed heavily with an aura of mutual respect , almost bringing tears to wayne's and the audience's eyes , as he reads the inscription that you know means so much to him . if you can see that as a glorious and magnificent scene , you will have , most likely , fallen in love with this grand and lyrical film . but if you don't , you can still be swept away by the eloquence of the film and its call for some kind of majesty of action one should have , in this beautiful , god created country , that ford believes has room in it for everyone who acts civilly .",DSc
"when considering this movie , a word analogy comes to mind . fear of a black hat is to cb4 as this is spinal tap is to airheads . having said that , i can assure you that two of those films ( black hat and spinal tap ) won't be mentioned again in this review . airheads isn't worth the comparison . observing how fertile the field of heavy metal music is for satire , it's disappointing to watch airheads bumble around , desperately trying to find something funny to say . even sadder is the continuing nosedive of director michael lehmann's once-promising career . the premise of airheads sounds promising . one problem , though . despite a chuckle here and there , most of airheads isn't worth the film it was processed on . it requires an effort to avoid gritting one's teeth as obvious comic opportunities are allowed to pass by untouched . on the other hand , most of the jokes actually offered up by the script are either unfunny , obvious , or both . the overt stupidity of the three leads is amusing for a little while , but it doesn't take long for this trait to become tiresome . airheads is not a good parody . its comedy has no real edge , and consistently avoids risks . on those rare occasions when the film takes a stab at being outlandish , it is funny , but that doesn't happen too often . most of the time , airheads flounders around trying--and failing--to be humorous . in that way , it's a lot like 1993's cb4 , a rap parody that was more dumb than witty . the cast contains some surprisingly good performers . brendan fraser , the film's resident heartthrob , displays little comic timing . it's hard to determine how much heavy-metal fanatics will enjoy this film , since the music isn't really the point . then again , considering the confused nature of airheads , it's a little difficult to determine whether or not this film has a point . anyway , regardless of who the target audience is , the filmmakers appear to have missed it . considering the poor quality of the production in general , and the screenplay in particular , airheads appears to be an apt title .",JBe
"a concept alone does not a movie make . like a computer virus , the rumor spreads rapidly , harming more than the intended victim . that's the theory anyway . working from an underdeveloped and ridiculous script by gregory poirier and theresa rebeck , davis guggenheim directs gossip with meat cleaver subtlety . it's too bad that the director didn't throw up his hands and go for pure camp . the over-the-top , creepy music ( graeme revell ) and the ominously dark cinematography ( andrzej bartkowiak ) would have nicely supported such an approach . as those of you unlucky enough to have seen body shots last year will notice , the art design looks similar , right down to the silly , pastel cocktails , served in a rainbow of colors . as a parody , the film might have at least worked its way up to a guilty pleasure . but , it is not to be . the director buys into the pretentious and preposterous story , producing groans from the audience instead of laughter . in a film full of ludicrous moments , permit me to choose a favorite . the movie is filled with thoughts that will make your blood boil .

"if you've ever seen or read an interview with vincent gallo , it's probably obvious why he decided to make his own movie : other people seem to irritate him to distraction . so rather than make a film with all the folks he holds in such contempt , gallo decided to do it all himself . wearing that many hats should qualify him as some sort of rack . fortunately , gallo has the head and the talent to pull it off for the most part . a visually provocative if occasionally under-developed character study , buffalo '66 tells the story of billy brown ( gallo ) , a lifetime loser from buffalo , ny . the premise sounds like the set-up for farce or black comedy , but buffalo '66 is actually a sharply-observed character study . gallo's billy is a portrait in emotional immaturity , his child-like name indicative of his inability to act like an adult . gallo is superb in front of the camera , but he's just as impressive behind it . typically , actors-turned-directors point their camera at the actors and let them do their thing . there's nothing typical about gallo , however . his direction tends towards the showy , but the show always reaches for a specific emotion . with the instincts of a visual artist , gallo makes buffalo '66 undeniably visual . it's only as a screenwriter that gallo comes up wanting . as complex and well-developed as billy may be , layla is that sketchy . the talented ricci tries to invest some real humanity in the character , but too often she's little more than a powder blue baby-doll fantasy . that choice only makes sense if buffalo '66 is an elaborate surrealist fable , which would negate much of the compelling pathos in billy's character . still , it's hard not to notice how much more gallo does right with buffalo '66 . he may have stretched his diverse talents thin , but he proved he could do it his way . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line "" subscribe "" .",SRe
"copycat is cinema at its best . we are talking edge of the seat thriller , but not because it's shocking , which is frequently is , but because it is an extremely well written , directed , and acted movie . this is the sort of movie that draws its audience into the story like a spider into its web until in the end , the picture is life , and you feel a part of it . when the house lights came up , i could hardly move . my one comment was a huge wow ! the show starts like any good murder mystery or thriller . my first reaction was this was going to be an enjoyable cop show with some good acting . it starts off at a normal pace from the station , but by the time the show is a third over , you are flying along . moreover , the last quarter of the movie is a leap into hyperspace the tension gets so thick , but at no time does the movie play with your emotions and no matter how gory the crime scenes , they never cross over the line by over doing any of the scenes . hunter is one of my favorite actresses perhaps because i have a southern accent like hers and am on the small side so i always identify with her . actually , i think she is more my idol . here she gives a possible academy award nomination performance . she has not been so good since one of my all time favorite movies , broadcast news , which i think no human being can see too often it is so brilliant . i am unhappy to report that the producers ( arnon milchan and mark tarlov ) of copycat felt she needed a dialog coach to tone down her southern accent a bit . hey , people with southern accents do move to places like san francisco and keep their accents . i know ; i did , and its okay . we do not need people to come and tell us how to speak "" right "" . weaver , who i think it is generally terrific , has been known to overdo it if not carefully directed . foley's specialty is like that of a great forger since he reproduces in sequence some of the most heinous serial killers of this century . this turns out to be a fascinating plot device and the script treats each small point , like how the sequence is determined , carefully . the tightly drawn violins of the music by christopher young add immensely to the overall feeling of dread and impending doom . the script by first time screenwriters ann biderman and david madsen is brilliant and the dialog is smart . like pulp fiction the writers know how to push the edge of the envelope , but they never step out of the bounds of good taste and reasonableness no matter how gruesome the material . the whole character of the agoraphobic is one which is so easy to make into caricature which they skillfully avoid . they even know when to introduce laughs to cut through the tension . the story is made highly creditable and believable from start to finish . the ending is perfect , and they avoid several possible cliched epilogues . i look forward to many more movies from them . this subplot was not of the same quality as the rest of the story , and if nico's entire role had been purged , the story would have been tighter and stronger still . the subtle but effective cinematography by laszlo kovacs has just the right blend of lightness and darkness to give an eeriness to everything without ever overpowering any of the scenes . the editing cuts at all of the right moments for maximum intensity . the makeup , especially on the doctor , adds to the realism . now for the real star of copycat , the director , jon amiel . like the first time screenwriters , there is nothing in his background to suggest greatness . both of these were good shows but nothing outstanding . here he keeps his actors and actresses so tightly wound and yet under control at the same time that is a joy to watch such directorial craft in action . i sure hope he decides to do many more thrillers . i can't wait . copycat runs for 2 : 03 , but you won't spend much time checking your watch . other than deleting the nico subplot , i think the show is near perfection and the pacing exactly right , albeit bordering on heart attach pace . the movie is rated r for violence , gory dead bodies , and nudity . the show would be suitable for teenagers , only if they are quite mature and are not prone to nightmares . i strongly recommend this show to you . you may want to see this picture with a friend who can walk you to the car afterwards . it is pretty intense , but don't be scared off ; it is a don't miss movie . it gets my rare ,  rating .",SRh
"on this , the 60th anniversary of that classic , sweetly hokey , but delightful romantic musical , love's labour's lost from 1940 , the studio is re-releasing it so that this generation can savor its charms . based on the shakespeare play of the same name , the movie features more song and dance numbers than you can count . you do remember it don't you ? the biggest production number is set to "" there's no business like show business .

"on the surface , it's easy to assume that sirens is a lighthearted erotic romp through the secluded wilds of australia's blue mountains in the 1930s . however , sirens is not content merely to churn through the frothy waters of a sex comedy . writer/director john duigan readily acknowledges that , with the exception of lindsay and his family , all of the characters are fictitious . the potential is here for a delightful comedy/fantasy with a decidedly erotic edge , but certain elements of the movie work against that aim . there is an underlying current of mean-spiritedness that feels inappropriate in a film striving for a light tone . the most sympathetic character emerges from sirens with the "" short end of the stick . "" not only are these weightier portions of the script at odds with what the rest of the film is trying to accomplish , but they're too sketchy and incomplete to add anything noteworthy to the overall story . they appear to have been included to inject an intellectual aspect into what is an otherwise lightweight motion picture . the acting is top-notch . hugh grant and sam neill are both excellent as friendly adversaries . elle macpherson's performance is limited in scope , but the role thankfully doesn't require the model-turned-actress to overextend herself . atmosphere is another major element of sirens , and that's handled well , aided by numerous shots of undulating snakes and lush vistas . as might be expected , nudity abounds , but most instances avoid seeming excessive or gratuitous , and men as well as women are displayed in various stages of undress . nevertheless , by trying to do perhaps too much with this film , mr . duigan has limited its effectiveness . as a vehicle for examining the subject of religion versus the freedom of artists , sirens is shallow , but the presentation of the issue dampens some of the lighthearted fun . sometimes , it's better not to try for substance with a basic premise this earthy .",JBe
"the beautician and the beast is one of those movies that tries so hard to be cute and romantic that it becomes sickeningly offensive . while the film probably holds some limited appeal for undemanding pre- teen girls , that's about the most positive thing i have to say about it . there's little evidence of originality , inventiveness , or freshness in this trite production . even if you accept that it's intended to be a song-less satire ( rather than a rip-off ) of the sound of music , it still comes across as flat . the story attempts to cram as many cliches as possible into an abysmal package . being forced to listen to fran drescher's new yawk accent for more than ninety minutes is enough to drive anyone to distraction , so , in an apparent attempt to camouflage how bad she sounds , the film makers decided to give all their actors horrible accents . of course , they all speak english , even though there's a throwaway reference to that not being the native language . it seems that even the poor , downtrodden peasants have mastered this second language . generally , i enjoy romantic comedies , even when they're hopelessly mired in formulas . however , for a movie of this sort to work its particular brand of magic , it has to possess intelligence or appeal , neither of which characterizes the beautician and the beast . at the outset , with a brief , clever animated sequence , the film seems to want to be different , but it isn't long before it has settled into a painfully bad rut . todd graff's script is television-quality writing at its worst , and the direction by ken kwapis , who made the better dunston checks in ( who would have ever thought i might use the word "" better "" to describe that film ? ) , does justice to the screenplay's pedestrian nature . her joy is consistently abrasive , although i suppose that's supposed to be part of drescher's dubious "" charm .

"a mindless psychological thriller set in vermont , that starts out in a promising mysterious fashion but ends badly , ruining any credibility it might have generated . it tries very hard to be both a mystery and a supernatural story , but it goes off course on both its aims way before it sinks to its low abyss . it was a film that was all foreplay but couldn't come to a climax , and as the film started to clear up the mystery mood it created while moving at its snail pace , the revelations of the mystery weren't worth exploring . the only thing the film did well , was provide a lot of schlock . the result is a dull film , with uninteresting and poorly developed characters , and too many manipulative fright scenes that i have seen before in too many other horror flicks . the only thing this film did really well aside from all its schlock setups , was photograph the lakeside lake champlain area and use the champlain bridge for some eerie shots . the story seemed to drag from the onset , as the director wasted time taking irrelevant long shots aimed to be frightening and then turning away from those shots without drawing anything out of them ; it should have been an eighty minute film , like the b- movies of the 1950s , and then it might have been a more tolerable venture . robert zemeckis ( "" forrest gump "" / "" contact "" / "" back to the future "" ) is such an emotionally empty director , his characters seem more like robots than humans , that the movie seems to be such an effort in draining the life out of it that it becomes mostly a special effect movie with characters becoming secondary in importance . zemeckis has built a story around a lady-in-peril , one with too much idle time , who is overwrought with a healthy dose of neurotic tension , talking herself into thinking she sees ghosts , but who doesn't know how to internalize that fright . michelle pfeiffer is asked to carry this film , but without an adequate script , even if she is a good casting decision for that role , her task is too difficult to accomplish . the last shocking scene takes place in a bathtub , one that could have been ordered from the sears catalogue before world war 11 , and seems to be ready-made for a horror flick . if this is supposed to be like a hitchcockian thriller , then why wasn't i thrilled by what i saw ! zemeckis has created an unaffecting haunted house thriller , with samples from many other films thrown into this derivative stew , but nothing seems to work here . this is just a boring movie about a couple that are as unreal as the ghosts in their house .",DSc

"screenplay : elaine may , based on the novel by anonymous . director : mike nichols . mpaa rating : r ( profanity , adult themes ) running time : 143 minutes . it's ironic that klein could tell a story about the effect of scandal-mongering on american politics only by creating a bit of scandal himself , that he could uncover a few brutal truths only by hiding a few . it's even more ironic that the film version of primary colors appears just as president clinton finds himself entangled in new scandals , virtually guaranteeing that most coverage of the film will both miss the point entirely and help make the film's point for it . primary colors isn't simply a chance to giggle at clinton's foibles without naming him . this is a story about giggling at foibles masquerading as serious news , about a political process which has become a seemingly endless cycle of mud-slinging and spin control because we continue to create an audience for it . in that sense , it's a very similar story to the recent wag the dog , though simultaneously more human and more cynical . does it matter that this man who wants to do so much for the country seems to be doing it one woman at a time ? do the ends of getting into office where you can do some good justify the means of slinging even more mud at the opponent than he slings at you ? and how can you make ideas worth anything in a culture where viewers watch an interview with the stantons and can only comment that susan "" should wear her hair longer . "" primary colors the movie manages to wrap all of the novel's tough questions and roman-a-clef characters into a surprisingly funny and entertaining package . though the running time of nearly 2-1/2 hours feels excessive near the end , director mike nichols crafts so many sharp comic scenes that the film never becomes a tedious political science lecture . he also gets one particularly dynamic performance from a generally solid cast -- kathy bates as libby , the stanton's borderline-loony long-time friend and the campaign's designated "" dust-buster "" ( because she's "" tougher than dirt "" ) . though the role initially seems like just a minor variation on bates' brassy , no-nonsense characters in dolores claiborne , the late shift or titanic , libby eventually develops into the real soul of primary colors : the last true idealist , a woman whose very sanity depends on the notion that there has to be a better way to select those who will lead us . of course , another performance will draw far more attention , which is precisely why primary colors couldn't possibly work as well on film as it does on the page . without a face , jack stanton is a complex and sympathetic character study representing a wide-spread problem . as effective as elaine may's script may be -- and travolta's performance , for that matter -- plenty of viewers will simply gape at primary colors in tabloid fascination , thinking of it as the bill clinton story . there's a sad lesson behind the laughs in primary colors , one you'll be able to spot in reviews and reactions colored by the lenses of intern-gate , grope-gate , or any other gate : we're getting exactly the leaders we deserve when we refuse to make their messages matter , and all we can do is throw up an endless series of gates in front of them . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line "" subscribe "" .",SRe

"the public loves it -- there are truman addicts who go to sleep with the tv on and who have sets installed in the bathroom so they don't miss anything when they're taking a bath . every individual in "" the truman show "" is an actor with one important exception : the lead character himself . he thinks this is all real , and his obliviousness to the situation gives the program its core appeal -- that there's nothing counterfeit about truman . for those who bemoan hollywood's consistent lack of originality ( as i frequently do ) , the truman show is a welcome surprise . over the years , there have been many satires about the power of television , but none has taken this route . the only thing i wonder is whether something this quirky will be able to find a large enough audience to justify the budget . paramount pictures is clearly using the truman show as an example of summer counterprogramming . the movie opens up a scant two weeks after godzilla and announces its intentions with the first line : "" we're tired of pyrotechnics and special effects ? "" but are we ? more importantly , is jim carrey's draw strong enough to pack theaters showing this movie , especially when his role here is light years away from the zany character he usually plays ? and how badly will marketing the truman show as a comedy hurt the movie when viewers realize that's not what it is ? these questions , which lie at the heart of the picture's hope for success , will be answered fairly quickly once it is released . for carrey detractors who are easily turned off by the comic's rubber-faced antics , the truman show proves to be an eye-opener . not only does carrey remain rigidly-controlled and reigned in , but it would be fair to call his performance both understated and effective . exhibiting the charm and charisma of a tom hanks or even a young jimmy stewart , carrey develops the sort of likable personae that a movie of this sort needs to succeed . most movies today run far too long , but the truman show is actually too short . a considerable amount of worthwhile material goes unexplored . i would have liked to know something about the personal pressures faced by the actors in "" the truman show "" and more about the incredibly complex logistics of controlling and filming the entire life of one man . narratively , the film is a little rough around the edges , as if a lot more was filmed than what shows up on-screen , but , although the flow may be off a little , it's not difficult to follow what's going on . stylistically , the truman show uses an interesting approach , intercutting documentary-like interviews and lengthy excerpts from the program ( these can be identified by the elliptical matte around the frame ) with "" real life "" footage of the director and behind-the-scenes people . weir isn't the first film maker to apply this technique ( it's a "" mockumentary "" staple ) , but he uses it to good effect , and it works well in the context of this movie . as an intriguing , well-written piece of entertainment and a mild social commentary , the truman show deserves high marks . not everything in the film works , and the script isn't perhaps as deep or incisive as it would like us to believe , but there's enough here to mark the truman show as a worthwhile motion picture -- an appealing , offbeat , one- hundred minute diversion for those who really are tired of monsters tearing down buildings and action heroes saving the world .

"here's an easy short-hand for thinking about the peacemaker : it's a james bond film without james bond . okay , so there's no sex and no vodka martinis , but the peacemaker comes with virtually everything else you could ask for in an espionage thriller : superbly crafted action sequences , a charismatic hero , marvelous production values , the threat of mass destruction , humor and style . at times , it's as satisfying an action film as 1997 has produced to date . that's bound to come as a surprise considering the folks both behind and in front of the camera . her sense of timing an action scene , ably assisted by editor david rosenbloom , creates tension in unlikely places ; her instinct for effective restraint ( like the positively heretical decision to show two trains hurtling towards one another , then cut away before the collision ) is uncommon and welcome . leder instantly distinguishes herself as a big-screen action director to watch for . george clooney , meanwhile , has previously distinguished himself on the big screen largely by not distinguishing himself , disappearing into the frenetic horror of from dusk till dawn and the inane vortex that was batman & robin . devoe displays an often ruthless military pragmatism , yet his very refusal to play politics gives many of his comic lines their bite . he's no bond , of course , which points out the one glaring deficiency keeping the peacemaker from being a great action film . the bond films' awareness of their own high-flying absurdity forced them to avoid self-importance , while also making it easy for viewers to overlook mediocre scripts . not only is michael schiffer's screenplay for the peacemaker too serious by half , it feels only half-finished . instead of an arrogantly megalomaniacal villain , or even an appealingly insane one , schiffer offers a somber , haunted bosnian surrounded by the somber , haunted ruins of sarajevo . leder adds a touch of irony with a passing shot of sarajevo's olympic rings , at least momentarily defusing the impression that the peacemaker is trying to make a political statement . as for the characters . . . let's just call them functional . there's a mechanical feel to the narrative flow of the peacemaker ; it moves from place to place or person to person with little connective tissue to hold it all together . it's an action machine , albeit an extremely well-oiled one . well-oiled action machines are rare enough that the peacemaker could find a receptive audience , perhaps the same audience anxiously awaiting james bond's next adventure . operating without a compelling script or the built-in goodwill which accompanies the planet's most famous secret agent , mimi leder and company manage to create a worthy challenger . with competition like bond , it's impressive that leder was neither shaken nor stirred . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line "" subscribe "" .",SRe

"it is a large movie painted on a vast canvas ultimately spanning almost a century . it then immediately switches to an isolated ranch in some of the most beautiful montana landscape you have ever seen . eventually , there are two girlfriends ( julie ormond and karina lombard ) as well plus lots of other minor characters . the biggest attraction for the movie is watching the visuals . the cinematography was perfect with 90% of the outdoor scenes carefully filmed in the last twenty minutes of twilight and always with the actors' hair back-lit by the setting sun . the indoor scenes were dark with the glow of candles or with light streaming in from the outside . travelogues never looked better . i expected to see someone selling land in montana in the lobby after the show ! unless you are a big fan of seeing hearts cut out of the bodies of animals and people or unless you feel you must see all of brad pitt's movies ( he is major handsome ) , i can see no reason to see this film other than as a long travelogue . the biggest problem i had with the movie was the script ( written by susan shilliday and bill wittliff ) and to a lesser degree the directing ( by edward zwick ) . there are so many ridiculous and unbelievable things these characters do that i ran out of fingers and toes counting them . totally unbelievable . i did not care about any of them . after forty-five minutes , i was looking at my watch hoping it would get better ( it actually got worse ) , and wondering when it would end . sad to say it ran for an incredibly long 2 : 13 . perhaps they are going to make it into a tv mini-series which is what it looked like anyway . it is correctly rated r for heavy violence . i recommend this movie only to those interested in relocating to montana . i award the movie  and suggest all of the proceeds of the show be paid directly to the cinematographer .",SRh
"suspect ( 1987 ) is an involving film , but one that is peppered with actions that are either implausible or at least highly improbable . if your ability to suspend disbelief is strong , you will probably find yourself enjoying some of the courtroom drama and thriller aspects of the film - numerous flaws and all . none of the acting is great , but it is fairly compelling , and director peter yates ( from the run of the country ) knows how to make entertaining films . sure . yes , this show is quite predictable . if a hollywood screenwriter makes a point of labeling someone a republican , the wardrobe department might as well have him wear a black hat through the rest of the picture . the music by michael kamen is sappy . whenever the director needs extra tension , and eric roth's script can't provide enough , yates turns to the composer to crack up the violins . actually , the script gets almost laughable at points . after complaining about not seeing a movie in a year and not being able to have a kid because she is too busy to date , riley laments , "" i spend all of my day with murders and rapists , and what's really crazy , i like them .

"in print and television interviews , everyone associated with reality bites has been trying desperately to convince potential viewers that it's not a "" generation x "" movie , but just a simple romantic comedy . yeah . right . reality bites follows slacker ; singles ; and bodies , rest & motion in the sweepstakes to most accurately capture the 20-something zeitgeist , but i found it more reminiscent of star winona ryder's breakthrough film heathers . while reality bites does include some very funny moments and finely observed insight , it also tends to reduce its central characters to a collection of kitschy bon mots . reality bites is strongest on the level of details and the number of individual laughs of recognition they provide . i will admit to participating in a group sing-along of "" conjunction junction "" like these characters , and to playing games based on sit-com episodes . vickie is perhaps the most recognizable type to me ; i know a few people who cover their walls with old music posters and beg for you to turn up bad power pop songs with memories of junior high school dances . more so than singles , reality bites identifies the sense of ideological drift that characterizes americans in their mid-20s , but without the moody self-importance of bodies , rest & motion . this is not to say that childress doesn't also give in to easy stereotypes . every parent in reality bites is characterized by a cartoonish materialism , and becomes an easy target for blame . the romantic triangle doesn't have quite the impact it could have had because as attractive as ryder is , she doesn't seem nearly as interesting as , say , vickie . troy is an even more problematic character , a first class self-absorbed jerk who philosophizes in bastardized advertising jingles . the transformation childress tries to foist off on us is far too contrived , and she seems too willing to let troy's attitude stand as an acceptable response to the world he perceives . fortunately , they are somewhat balanced by two delightful supporting performances . comic janeane garofolo ( tv's the larry sanders show ) is hysterical as vickie , displaying a natural timing which makes the most mundane lines funny . director ben stiller is charming as lelaina's perpetually flustered suitor , and should be congratulated for risking the hesitating delivery which makes his character appear very real . i have to note that i was extremely disappointed by the ending of reality bites , but that may say more about me than about the film . while there are numerous character stumbles , overall i felt the tone was on target , and i laughed a lot . reality bites off a bit more than it can chew , but it all goes down eventually .",SRe

"with a title like g . i . jane , it would be easy to dismiss ridley scott's latest effort as exploitation fare . such a reaction , however , would do the picture an injustice . on the other hand , the movie lacks the thematic depth that the film makers would like to attribute to it . basically , this is a high-grade testosterone flick , which is ironic , considering that the lead actor is one of the 1990s' top female screen sex symbols , demi moore . while g . i . jane is admittedly effective at doing most of what it attempts , the problem lies in its lack of ambition . we've seen movies like this , about honor and courage in the military , since hollywood discovered the war genre . many of the trappings may be different , but , at its core , g . i . this film also owes more than a small debt to the acclaimed richard gere movie , an officer and a gentleman . anyone who has seen that picture , or any other like it ( and there are a lot out there ) , will recognize every perfunctory and formulaic turn in g . i . jane's script . it seems like more than just six years since director ridley scott made thelma and louise , and virtually another lifetime since he was responsible for the science fiction classics alien and blade runner . recently , scott's work has varied from moderately entertaining ( white squall ) to downright awful ( the ill-advised 1492 ) . g . i . jane is not likely to inflate his sinking reputation . in fact , this is the kind of generic output we have come to expect from his brother , tony . actually , if you strip away all of the details surrounding scott's most recent films , white squall and g . i . jane , you'll find that their naked plot skeletons look strikingly similar . both feature a small group of intense individuals enduring difficult physical and mental conditions . each offers a hard-bitten authority figure whose apparently cruel lessons turn out to be invaluable . ultimately , it's possible to find numerous parallels between white squall and g . i . jane , which may indicate that scott has an affinity for this sort of material . of course , it's impossible to discuss this movie without mentioning its "" issue "" : women's equality in the military . unfortunately , the film's shallow ( albeit sincere ) treatment of the subject is more obligatory than thorough or thoughtful . and , although g . i . jane avoids being overly preachy , it also doesn't offer any new or interesting insights , and doesn't come close to the level of intelligence displayed by last year's courage under fire in tackling a different aspect of the same issue . the movie's two main points , that there is no true equality in the military and that politicians will trade the moral high ground for political favors , are obvious . with a buff physique that has to be the result of an aggressive training regimen , demi moore has the body of an action heroine . unfortunately , the dramatic aspects of her performance are not impressive enough to eclipse her personality . truly gifted actors quickly shed their own image in favor of the character's . in this case , however , we're consistently aware that this is demi moore playing jordan o'neil , rather than a unique individual come to life on the screen . we never forget the actress long enough to lose ourselves in the character , and this awareness limits g . i . jane's potential impact . with g . i . jane , scott has crafted an action/drama of passable entertainment value , but there's little here to astound or amaze any but the most casual or naive viewer . the movie does a reasonable job of engrossing an audience for two hours -- it's the kind of high energy , fast-paced film where you can guiltlessly root for the heroine to persevere -- but that's all it succeeds at . g . i . jane is for those who prefer to cheer at the screen than be challenged by what's playing on it .",JBe
"the opening credits of dangerous beauty , thankfully , say the story is true -- it's based on margaret rosenthal's biography "" the honest courtesan . "" were it not true , as it claims to be so , the frequently ridiculous , silly plot would have had the audiences laughing at all the wrong places . we learn , for example , that most women of that era , with the exception of courtesans , were not able to read . for those of you who have trouble suspending disbelief in movies , this film may short-circuit your brain . jeannine dominy's screenplay adaptation takes a modern language approach , laced with poetry , that might be termed shakespeare-lite , so there are ample opportunities to ridicule the picture if you are so inclined . but don't get me wrong , as filmed in a romantic haze by bojan bazelli and as sumptuously decorated by norman garwood , the production dazzles the eyes at every turn . even more dazzling and bizarre is the film's opening . ( this much nudity so early in a picture is not a good sign . ) the script likes to include advice , witty and bawdy . the movie has the potential to become a camp classic . although the costumes look authentic , especially the ridiculous eight-inch platform shoes that the courtesans wear , the simple make-up looks exactly like what you see on the street today . she has a book published of her poetry and engages the men in duels of poetry , sometimes lewd but more often not . as absurd as it is at times , the movie , directed by marshall herskovitz from the tv series "" my so-called life , "" can be quite cute . and with its full plate of romance , jealousy , humor , titillation and even a bit of pathos , it tries to please everyone . but the ending scene , which you've seen a hundred times before , neatly wraps it all up . although parts of the picture are enjoyable , the characters never rise above playacting . like some ribald tale from the playboy channel but with most of the sex scenes edited out , the movie is never sure what it wants to be . it's certainly not soft porn , but neither is it is very substantial . it is rated r for nudity , sex and profanity and would be acceptable for teenagers if they are both older and mature .",SRh
"hollywood is a hotbed of ideas these days . remakes . or so they seem to think . after all , what's easier than remaking a movie that audiences have liked before ? as crass as this approach is , it does produce some modestly entertaining films , the thomas crown affair , directed by die hard's john mctiernan , being one . although this is not particularly inspired casting , neither is a bad choice . crown is a kleptomaniac for the fun of it . he wagers not because he thinks he'll make the putt but because he just enjoys the thrill of the gamble . with brosnan's looks and charm , this is probably the easiest part of the story to believe . the performance by the usually reliable rene russo is another matter entirely . perhaps because action director mctiernan is unable to give her proper guidance or perhaps because of her harsh , heavy make-up , russo delivers a performance that's sometimes funny , but too often stiff . the setup for the movie has a trojan horse full of burglars delivered to what is clearly the metropolitan museum of art in new york . as the tough , by-the-book detective michael mccann , denis leary gives the funniest performance in the movie . the negative chemistry between the two is delicious . at its worst , as in the bizarre character of crown's psychiatrist ( faye dunaway ) , the movie becomes ridiculous . this subplot is a needless distraction in a film that needs more focus and energy . for work of a director known for his proclivity to blow things up , the movie moves at a remarkably languid pace . even if you can guess parts of the ending , the exact way the story gets resolved is a genuine treat . full of inventiveness and audience pleasing twists , the story ends on an especially satisfying high note . it is rated r for sex , nudity and language . if the few nude scenes had been deleted , which would have been a decided improvement , the movie would have been rated pg-13 and appropriate for kids 10 and up . as it is , the movie would be fine for those 15 and up .",SRh
"what happens when you start out with a decent mystery premise , a solid lead actor , and a script that builds suspense nicely through the first half before inexplicably self-destructing in the most messy and unpleasant manner ? you have either 1993's benefit of the doubt or 1994's silent fall , thrillers that share a number of unfortunate traits , the most notable of which is an inability to construct a worthwhile picture despite several apparent advantages . bruce beresford , who is in the director's chair for this film , has a history of inconsistency . silent fall isn't a movie for which beresford will want to be remembered . the first fifty minutes of the film have their high points--a nice buildup , some attempts ( although predictable ones ) at setting up character relationships , and a suitably creepy atmosphere . however , developments in the second half easily make the viewer forget whatever good things came before . the plot gets out-of-hand and , like a boulder barreling down a mountainside , the implausibilities and contrivances gather speed until a disaster is unavoidable . the catastrophe comes in the form of what the film makers apparently decided to call a "" conclusion .

"screenplay : robert king . all right , all right , we get the point : despite all similarities to the best-selling story , speechless is * not * based on the romance between 1992 presidential campaign rivals james carville and mary matalin . in fact , the script was in development well before 1992 . no , it's not that the speechless twosome are speech writers , not campaign managers ; it's that carville and matalin's story is actually interesting . speechless is a limp , poorly structured would-be romantic comedy . the standard formula for a movie like speechless would have the two principles starting out as antagonists and realizing only at the end that they're crazy about each other . it's a noble attempt to shake things up , but unfortunately it just doesn't work . part of the fun of watching sparring in a romantic comedy comes from recognizing the chemistry even before the characters do , but in speechless they already know they're attracted to each other , and we're left with waiting for the campaign to end so they'll admit that they love each other already . there is such a herky-jerky feel to the constant bickering and making up that even king's sharp dialogue can't prevent speechless from becoming repetitive after about half an hour . inconsistency is also the defining characteristic of the performances of geena davis and michael keaton , and with those performances most of their scenes together . the problems begin with their initial courtship , which does virtually nothing to establish julia's character and merely establishes that kevin is a wise-ass . davis is radiantly beautiful , and keaton is generally entertaining , but these characters are so plastic that nothing that happens to them seems to matter one bit . in a couple of scenes , like a quiet moment sitting at a fountain , they actually achieve some measure of connection . for the most part , however , they're just actors spouting lines . you keep waiting for a little spark , and it never happens . perhaps most disappointing is that king and director ron underwood completely waste their premise by removing all the punch from speechless's politics . the setting seems perfect for a high- energy battle of the sexes with partisanship thrown into the mix , but that's never the tone that underwood is going for . he wants a warm , fuzzy romance compatible with marc shaiman's flute-and-wind musical score , and the campaign which should have defined the conflict between kevin and julia fades into the background . it might as well have been a story about rival grocers , and every single character is about as uninspired as he or she could possibly be . i was about the only reviewer in the civilized world who seemed to enjoy robert king's previous screenplay , the dana carvey flop clean slate , so i had some hopes for speechless . but while there is wit in the words , this is a script which was probably much better on paper . on screen , it's still paper thin .",SRe
"director : jan de bont . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( adult themes , profanity , violence ) running time : 110 minutes . it's too bad there couldn't have been a bit more distance between the release of the blair witch project and the making of the haunting -- then , at least , director jan de bont wouldn't have had an excuse . with recent history to consider , it may have made a perverse economic sense to turn shirley jackson's supremely creepy story into a special effects-filled funhouse . then along comes blair witch to prove that you can still rattle an audience with what might be happening rather than a computer-generated representation of what is happening . ironically , blair witch owes a debt to the original 1963 version of the haunting in its study of the psychology of fear . sadly , the haunting circa 1999 owes a debt to jan ( twister , speed 2 ) de bont in its study of thick-headed filmmaking . an even more bitter irony is that this version of the haunting gathers its characters for a study of the psychology of fear . researcher jeffrey marrow ( liam neeson ) brings together three subjects for an experiment , telling them only that it's a study of insomnia . it's fairly clear from the start that the real star of the haunting is the house itself . de bont sprinkles the film liberally with sweeping helicopter shots of the sprawling exterior ; he prowls through the bending hallways and pans across cavernous great rooms ; he lets cinematographer caleb deschanel bathe the ornate bedrooms in muted oranges and reds . eugenio zanetti's production design is certainly eye-catching , offering more detail than one could possibly absorb in one sitting , but at a certain point the sprawling staginess of the house starts to work against the film . it begins to feel like disney's haunted mansion crossed with the winchester mystery house , a tourist attraction designed more for spooky giggles than for genuine shivers . once the house fails to deliver the creepiness , you're left with the treatment of the material , which is literalist to the mundane extreme . robert wise's 1963 the haunting was hardly perfect -- julie harris' hand-wringing fussiness took her nell too far over the edge from the start -- but it began from the principle that fear is about anticipation , not revelation . de bont has no interest in any such subtleties . instead of making a film about the way an environment of terror is more powerful in imagination than in reality , he makes a film about faces appearing in pillowcases , leaping skeletons , windows that turn into big staring eyeballs , and living statues a la ray harryhausen . with its foundation-shaking finale and monstrous apparitions , this isn't a remake of the haunting . it's a remake of poltergeist . of course there's a place for the poltergeists of cinema . generally , however , it helps if that sort of film can tap into something primal , like scary clowns or menacing trees . the haunting can't really be classified as a horror film , because there's nothing remotely horrifying about it , unless you count the inanely expository dialogue ( e . g . , a character reacting to a stairway collapsing : "" look , the stairway is collapsing ! "" ) . in fact , it's often downright laughable -- sometimes intentionally ( owen wilson's goofball performance ) , sometimes not ( a blissed-out otherworldly ending that makes ghost look restrained ) . de bont has made a film from the school of quips and money shots , all flash and chuckle . he's merely interested in showing off his big-budget toys so everyone can see the thing that goes ooga-booga . that's a pretty limp take on a tale of the ooga-boogas inside our heads . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .",SRe

"it answers in the affirmative . the screenplay by richard lagravenese is based on the novel by robert james waller that the entire western world except me has read , reread and cried themselves to sleep with . the movie is the story of this affair . we are talking serious , romantic , long lasting stuff here , not your usual sexual fling that hollywood is so fond of . most of the plot is predicable after the initial setup and that is okay . the point is not to guess the next plot twist , but to identify with the characters and vicariously live their romance and have that illicit fling you subconsciously always wanted . i thought the plot outline was wonderful , but i found the writing pretty leaden most of the time with sporadic poetic or more lively parts . i think i would have hated the novel , but maybe not . the outdoor scenes were easy to make picture card perfect and serene . wonderful , radiant glows filled the house . watching it was like drinking a warm cup of earl grey tea . it filled your body with contentment . the directing ( clint eastwood ) and the editing is of the slow and dreamy school of movie making . lots of silence or throw away dialog so that the characters can just sit around and stare romantically into each other's eyes . the pacing found me checking my watch frequently . i would not recommend the late showing , you may fall asleep in the slow parts . there are several precious scenes in the show . there is a romantic walk after dark that has a great mood to it . the chirping crickets really add to the ambiance . as a contrast , the scene in the local coffee shop is quite an eye opener and nicely done . the acting by eastwood is the best in the movie . he plays a more quiet and sensitive character than i have ever seen him play before . her accent was unnecessary and a major detraction . it was a parody of sophie's choice , but with a different european accent , except they both sounded the same . whereas eastwood's performance was convincing , i did not buy streep's . all this notwithstanding , you can count on her getting an academy award nomination for it . for a much better performance by streep having an affair , see faling in love . in it , she has genuine chemistry with robert de niro and does not use her one-size-fits-all european accent . the minor characters were good . better editing would have vastly increased my enjoyment as would having streep lose that fake accent . the movie is rated pg-13 for subtle lovemaking . it is fine for teenagers and probably kids 10 and up . for many special scenes , i give the picture a mild thumbs up regardless of its irritations , and i award it  .",SRh
"there are moments when the relic is almost enjoyable , albeit in a visceral sort of way . unfortunately , when all is said and done , this horror/science fiction amalgamation seems like nothing more ambitious than a bad reworking of elements from aliens , species , jaws , and predator . except for the choice of protagonists and the setting , there's nothing remotely new here . director peter hyams ( one of the few film makers to act as his own cinematographer ) , who once helmed sean connery in outland , manages to occasionally elevate the tension to a level that arrests the audience's attention , but it doesn't lead to anything worthwhile . the ending is a classic example of deus ex machina -- a sudden , unexpected turn-of- events that leaves movie-goers shaking their heads sadly and wondering why the screenwriters couldn't have thought up something more reasonable and satisfying . the second half of the movie , which is by far the most energetic , involves a gala celebration at the museum that turns into a bloodbath when the creature gets loose and starts beheading people and sucking out their brains . while these may have been important plot aspects of the novel upon which the relic is based , all they manage to accomplish here is to add minutes to the running time without providing any valuable insight into what's going on . to borrow a term , the relic is basically designed as a "" bug hunt "" ; attempts to make it anything more intelligent or interesting fail . penelope ann miller definitely isn't classic action heroine material . she looks nice in a slinky black dress and can let out a pretty decent scream , but she's too petite to get involved in any face- to-face combat . i suppose these two deserve credit for maintaining such a level of earnestness amidst all the cliches . this kind of movie has a built-in audience , although it's not clear how large that audience is . we've seen so many variations on this same story that it's gradually losing whatever appeal it once held . the relic isn't the film to inject new life into the sub-genre . instead , this is just the latest attempt to milk a mostly-dry formula , and the result is what you might expect -- a slick , gory motion picture with lots of cheap shocks , including the obligatory cat jumping out of the darkness . such a poor payoff is hardly a good reason to shell out the price of admission at the box office .",JBe

"like most television performers venturing into feature films , fran drescher chose a first starring vehicle which would be comfortable in its familiarity . not much of a stretch , it would seem , until you take into account the fact that drescher isn't just playing a nanny in this case -- she's stepping into the shoes of the quintessential representation of screen nanny-dom , julie andrews . you see , the beautician and the beast may be part variation on "" beauty and the beast "" and part variation on the old "" fish-out-of-water "" comedy , but at its core it is something else . the beautician and the beast is really the sound of music remade , with a nasal new yawka instead of a novitiate . that may not sound terribly appealing , and indeed the extent to which you will enjoy the beautician and the beast may depend on how much of drescher you can take in one sitting . the beautician and the beast is a slight , meandering little film which is hard to get a handle on . todd graff's script goes most of the expected places , creating conflict between the controlling boris and the uncontrollable joy and providing stock characters like a good advisor ( ian mcneice ) to take joy's side and a bad advisor ( patrick malahide ) to make the soon-to-be-reformed boris look better by comparison . he also tosses in obscure references ( how many audience members are going to remember norma rae ? ) and scatters his multiple sub-plots all over the pace to be picked up whenever time permits . the plot drifts from joy's street-wise counsel to each of boris's children to preparations for the arrival of potential foreign investors , never really lingering anywhere long enough for the events to be of anything but casual interest . director ken kwapis doesn't develop any kind of comic rhythm in beautician , allowing many of the thin gags to stand alone . i suppose one alternative to creating a structure is swiping one , hence the extended riff on the sound of music . the similarities could almost be represented by one of those tables with the two films as the headings . i would not have been surprised to hear timothy dalton break into a chorus of "" edelweiss "" at least the beautician and the beast ends where the sound of music should have ended , with the kiss before all the political upheaval . the romance in the film is actually fairly appealing , thanks largely to the entertaining work of timothy dalton . he has a gruff , goofy charm as the stalin-esque dictator who grows warm and cuddly , giving spark to boris' sudden desire to become a populist even if it doesn't make much sense . he also shares a nice chemistry with drescher whenever she tones down the attitude for a quieter moment , but quiet is a relative consideration where drescher is concerned . there is also no question that it can be distracting , even if it is her calling card and gives her an edge many female comics could use more of . if you can get past the drescher drone , you might be able to ride along on the feather-light romantic comedy of the beautician and the beast . when the sound of the leading lady is hardly the sound of music , however , that kind of enjoyment may not be as simple as do-re-mi .",SRe

"it isn't just josh's tale , however . and at what point does the need to win become so important that the game ceases to be fun ? it's then that chess becomes a burden and he stops enjoying it . we never learn exactly what demons haunt pandolfini , and it's a credit to this film that it doesn't make them explicit . there are enough clues that they can be guessed at , and searching for bobby fischer relies upon the intelligence of its audience to put the pieces together . there are four key relationships in this film , each of which is explored with varying success . even the weakest , that of josh and his mother ( joan allen ) , has an emotional depth unusual for the amount of screen time accorded to it . of all the adults in the film , only bonnie waitzkin never loses sight of what's best for her son . it's clear that the two are fond of each other , and vinnie's tactics become important to josh's development as a player , but we don't see enough of the two of them together to get a genuine sense of the mutual respect that grows between them . this kind of pressure is too much to put on a young boy , no matter how gifted he is , and it takes a threat by bonnie to make this clear and put the situation in perspective . also explored in some detail are josh's interactions with bruce pandolfini . these are men with faults , but it's those imperfections that enable us to empathize with them . neither actor has an overabundance of screen time with which to develop a personality , but good performers can do quite a bit with an economy of scenes . joan allen , despite often being relegated to the background , gives a convincing portrayal of a mother who cares so much about her son's well-being that she's willing to take him away from his father , if necessary , to assure it . realism was important to the film makers--they wanted chess-playing viewers to be spared the indignity of watching someone faking playing the game . in max pomeranc , an excellent choice was made . he's not the best child actor to grace the screen , but he avoids the awkward obviousness of many . searching for bobby fischer is an intensely fascinating movie capable of involving those who are ignorant about chess as well as those who love it . the focus of the film is less on the actual game than it is on the people , emotions , and pressures surrounding josh . it is a tale of human trials and triumph , not a sports movie that panders to a certain segment of the population . chess may not be the most exciting activity to watch , but searching for bobby fischer makes for engaging entertainment . one final note : even though this film might seem like a perfect family movie with its lack of violence , profanity , and sex , i would caution parents considering taking their children to searching for bobby fischer . with its focus on character development and drama , many younger viewers will likely become quickly bored . this is an "" adult "" movie ill-suited to those with short attention spans .",JBe
"these two actors alone , make it an interesting film . but to be fair , i think director gary fleder , whose last picture was the uniformly panned things to do in denver when you're dead , would have been hard-pressed to make a bad film with these actors . perhaps it is the tv-movie-of-the-week quality script by david klass , based on a novel by james patterson , that should reap most of the blame for not being able to fashion a credible story line out of a promising concept . i have a fairly high tolerance for implausibility , but a film that has you and your wife counting the unbelievable parts at the end is a bad sign . but still , the movie is entertaining and the acting good . if you've been in the south recently , you know this is no longer true . this hint at racial prejudice is never subsequently developed . although the common characteristics of the women are that they are gifted individuals , for example , dr . cross's niece is an accomplished violinist , they share the usual stupidity rampant in bad scripts . judd's part is smaller than it seems . in many of the scenes she has little to do other than stand around , and her acting talent is largely wasted aside from her few meaty scenes . why they didn't get lots of back-up is never fully answered . the director is fond of having characters look straight at the camera with the "" i'm the one "" look . and several twists are almost advertised in advanced with neon signs . -- about six car lengths and with no cars between them . it is rated r for bloody violence , a little profanity , and adult themes . the show would be fine for teenagers and probably could appear unedited for television . the performances by the leads are just barely enough for me to give the show a mild thumbs up and  .",SRh

"con air , producer jerry bruckheimer's generic follow-up to 1996's blockbuster , the rock , is the kind of motion picture that critics refer to when they moan about the "" dumbing down "" of american cinema . this movie is a perfect example of what's wrong with many big-budget films today : no characters , no intelligence , and , worst of all , little fun . although director simon west intends for con air to be a comic book come to life , it lacks the visual flair and imagination of all but the most trite comics . the film relies on impressive pyrotechnic displays , but it has been a long time since a well-executed explosion enraptured an audience . con air is noisy and flashy , but that can be said about any of the numerous , same-genre pictures that reach screens every year . what the movie lacks are tension and excitement to go along with all the bangs . the action sequences are presented in a pedestrian fashion , and there are too few instances when we feel that the protagonist is in any real danger . at least con air isn't as obviously bad as turbulence . for starters , this film has a couple of assets that the earlier "" terror in the sky "" film lacked : nicolas cage and john cusack . while the actors are far from their career best here ( in fact , cage often looks bored ) , mediocre acting from these two is preferable to what we got from ray liotta and lauren holly . actually , the really colorful performances belong to the actors playing the criminals . con air divides the characters into clearly-defined groups of good and bad ( with the members of the latter category vastly outnumbering those of the former ) . predictably , with no shades of gray , there isn't one interesting character . he's too clean to be anything but bland , and , worse still , scott rosenberg's script doesn't give him any of the one-liners that we've come to expect from action heroes in this sort of movie . he's like john mclane of die hard without the wisecracking charisma . another thing that's noteworthy about con air is how poorly it's patched together . in his recent review of the movie rough magic , film critic roger ebert made the observation that "" it's a cliche to talk about great visuals , since if you point a camera in the right direction you can make almost anything look good .

"angela pope's hollow reed is one of the most striking , forceful films to emerge onto the american art house scene so far this year , but , like many powerful motion pictures , it can be extremely difficult to watch . and , while the beatings aren't as graphic or brutal as those in another recent domestic violence motion picture , once were warriors , they're all the more wrenching because , in this case , the victim is a ten year old boy . yet , if hollow reed's sole subject matter had been child abuse , it wouldn't have been as provocative or challenging . equality is a word that everyone loves to speak , but , in today's world , there are times when it remains a distant fantasy . part of the reason that hollow reed is so punishing is that it's told from a child's point-of-view . relating the story from oliver's perspective allows us to better understand the fear , confusion , and self-blame that the child experiences . physical damage isn't the only byproduct of abuse ; it has deep-reaching psychological ramifications as well , the effects of which can be far more lasting . oliver's reasons for not telling are complex , and hollow reed makes his silence on the subject seem completely rational under the circumstances . understandably , he doesn't like frank , but , while the movie casts him in the role of the villain , it manages to humanize him to a degree , offering a motivation for his actions . his impotence ratchets up the level of tension that pope works so hard to create . hollow reed isn't meant to be a thriller , but the tone is darker and more ominous than is typical for a drama . the key to donovan's performance is that it starts out low-key . however , all of the adults , including richardson , donovan , and the fine supporting cast , are outacted by young sam bould , who captures the essence of oliver without a hint of the confusion and awkwardness that sometimes marks child performances . bould has many memorable moments -- hiding under a work bench so that frank won't find him , preparing to defend himself with a chisel , and bravely enduring the punishment that frank dishes out . in life , there are no easy answers , and hollow reed is nothing if not an accurate mirror of reality . this is not the sort of motion picture that's likely to find favor with the "" feel good "" crowd , but , if you aren't afraid of a movie that is capable of challenging convictions and wrenching emotions , hollow reed makes for an unforgettable two hours .",JBe

"" hard target is , in essence , an example of the victory of style over substance . when it comes to the "" typical "" criteria by which a film is judged , this movie fails badly . its characters are poorly-developed , the plot is the pinnacle of absurdity , and the acting , at best , is well over-the-top . nevertheless , on the most basic , visceral level , the film succeeds . those who went to last action hero and left disappointed because they expected a straight action film , will likely accord redemption to the summer of '93 because of hard target . albeit with a thinner plot , this is the kind of no-holds-barred chase , fight , and shoot-out picture that has become a schwarzenegger staple . van damme has an accent , the charisma , the physique , and the lack of acting skills . really , unless you're paying the check , it's hard to tell the difference . indeed , he doesn't merely direct this movie , he choreographs it , turning simple fight sequences into ballets of bloodshed . it's compelling , albeit a little disconcerting , to see violence so lovingly and carefully photographed . hard target isn't some hack job--a lot of effort went into crafting the picture . snipped and put back together to avoid an nc-17 , the film still offers a lot of mayhem and murder . it would have been interesting to see the cut that represented woo's initial vision . there is perhaps a little too much slow-motion photography , and the score , while capturing the flavor of louisiana , often becomes intrusive . early in the film , it seems that every time we're treated to a shot of van damme , he's walking towards us in slow-motion with his overcoat flapping in the breeze while an unnecessary blast of music blares from the theater speakers . the first half of the film occasionally slows up for some silly exposition , but by the mid-point , the hunt is underway , and it's all action from there . if , by five minutes into the movie , you haven't put your brain into park , this is going to seem like an utterly ridiculous effort . those who are willing to get into the spirit are in for a roller-coaster ride directed by a master and acted by someone who knows how to kick higher than most people can jump . i'm not going to say much about the plot , because it's far too contrived to be worth mentioning . suffice it to say that if the success of hard target depended on it , the movie would be sunk . even for the action-oriented film-goer , there are a few moments too hard to swallow ( where's the "" s "" on van damme's chest ? ) . if nothing else , they're good for comic relief which , fortunately ( or should i say "" hopefully "" ) seems to be woo's intent . he's fun to watch , but he goes so far over-the-top that i'm not sure it would be justified to call what he does a "" performance "" . regardless , he provides an excellent and much-needed counterpoint to van damme's ho-hum delivery . the hero , after all , is good with his kicks and punches , but not his lines . yancy butler does a poor job , even considering the company she keeps . someone who can make van damme look like a drama school graduate really needs to take some acting lessons ( although , admittedly , there's a scene with a snake where she's fantastic ) . and couldn't they have gotten someone a little more lively than wilford brimley for chance's lunatic uncle ? anyway , you pretty much get the idea . without the elegant technique of john woo , hard target could have been a real dud . it is not a good alternative to more intelligent thrillers such as in the line of fire and the fugitive , but that's not the market it's aimed at . however , those that enter a darkened theater showing this film with a reasonable idea of what they're getting themselves into , are likely to emerge satisfied .",JBe
"holy smoke is a beautiful film to watch -- from the feverish credit sequence -- of the film's title written in smoky letters , to kate winslet's psychodelic-like india sojourn , and then onto her trying experiences in the naturally scenic australian outback . the film has perfectly framed scenes and magnificent visuals , and a divertingly amusing storyline to tune into , even if it gives into its own silly side and becomes after a fast start mostly a wonderfully entertaining film touching on many societal nerve points but going nowhere but back into its own cynical view of life , resorting to a politically safe response to all its pin pricks about mind control . though , in all honesty , it should be commended for taking chances and telling its guru story in this refreshingly different style . how perceptive of a film it is , is questionable , as it is provocatively stimulated by overwrought acting and filled with the aussie taste for slapdash comedy and vulgar dialogue . there is too much of a loss of subject context to do any serious intellectual damage about any of the themes it broaches . but it does , on the serious side of its agenda , at least , raise some valid points about mind control and how men treat women . it is scripted by the campion sisters ( jane & anna ) and directed by jane , with a very noticeable woman's touch and a ribald sense of lustiness . at the gathering , there is a gaudily resplendent array of yellow and pink colors to dazzle the senses , seeming more like a light show for a jefferson airplane concert at the fillmore west than a religious ceremony . but mom has trouble adjusting to india : its crowds , lack of modern toilets , and its strange culture . all of their warmth and smiles for her seem disingenuous , especially when compared to the guru's . he also goes heavy on the mouth spray , making sure he is sweet-smelling at all times . the two go off to the outback as p . j . puts into motion his 3-day step program , and the breakdown in the film's sensibility becomes astronomical at this point , making me wonder what the campion sisters were thinking . the film loses its sense of credibility and becomes a battle of the sexes , with the inevitable male-female struggle taking precedence over the heavy-handed religious aspects first introduced into the story . in reality , praying does not guarantee that one's prays will be answered . so , in short , he's not for her , and no matter what he does won't work , which kills the romance part to this screwball comedy . what does this all mean , not too much , except its fun to see keitel get his stereotypical male psyche bruised and ham it up as kate turns the tables on him . but , ah ! those breasts of kate are really something to behold . . . but it is her personality that is the star of the film . she was the only one in the film who wasn't a shallow caricature , and her performance was daring , even smashing , taking this zany script and making the most of it , getting out of it certainly more than it deserved . which means the film actually worked in some skewed sense , as it dove into the question of mind control and the human condition and gave no answers , except the strong suggestion that having compassion for another person is what has to emerge from a person's heart before they can be expected to be free from their karma . and , in a muddled way , this film lets the audience be the observer and lets it come to its own conclusions , which is why i imagine this film will get a mixed-bag of reviews-- ranging from those who can't stand it , to those who rave about it . there were so many wasted moments that blunted this beautifully shot film , that shot itself unecessarily in the foot , even though it did manage to escape from being a dud by its freaky humor and its nonstop assault on the senses of propriety , making this a madcap comedy instead of anything else . it also badly underutilized the talented pam grier , giving her such a miniscule and predictable part , that she had no chance to do her thing . but what it had going for it , is a sense of freedom , an eye for beauty , and kate's undaunting performance , which makes it something to put in your pipe and smoke . if only it wasn't so ridiculous , it could have been a much more salient film , even if it were to lose a few laughs along the way .",DSc

"many chinese films exported during the past half-decade ( or so ) have shared a fondness for tragic melodrama . titles such as ju dou , raise the red lantern , farewell my concubine , temptation of a monk , to live , and shanghai triad all end bleakly . this isn't necessarily a bad thing ( in fact , some of the above movies are excellent ) , but it creates certain expectations when viewing a motion picture originating from mainland china . to a large extent , blush delivers what we anticipate , although the ending isn't as joyless as those of its many predecessors . unlike many of the movies that came before it ( such as to live and farewell my concubine ) , blush doesn't have a cynical or negative perspective of the liberation . her depiction of the revolution and its aftermath is evenhanded . the film opens as the prostitutes from the red happiness inn in shanghai are being herded like sheep into a re-training center . despite the subtitles , scrupulously accurate period details , and strong acting , blush is basically a cinematic soap opera . this fundamentally unsatisfying method of presentation undercuts the film's dramatic power . the ending is especially weak because a key aspect of the denouement is described , but never depicted . blush's primary message is that , to survive , people can adapt to any situation . for xiao'e , the final destination is the same , but , because she is less stubborn and more manipulative , her route is less turbulent . really , it's the historical context that makes this movie worthwhile , although primarily for those with interest in the era . there's nothing remarkable about the storyline , and the tear-jerking is only marginally successful . nevertheless , the movie affords us another perspective of a period in modern chinese history that has already received much film exposure . blush is well-paced and moderately entertaining , but it lacks the depth which has characterized many other , recent exports from that part of the world . sadly , this basic deficiency makes for a largely unmemorable motion picture .",JBe

"leo tolstoy's anna karenina , bernard rose's ( immortal beloved ) attempt to bring the great russian novel to the screen , is , in its own way , as flawed and unsuccessful as its illustrious predecessors . as an unabashed fan of the novel , i have never been impressed by hollywood's tepid attempts to film it . even with luminaries like greta garbo and vivien leigh in the title role , the stripped-down story has barely resembled its inspiration , looking instead like an overplotted , costume melodrama . anna karenina is not unfilmable ( a 10-part bbc mini-series made during the '70s was quite good ) , but , given the time constraints of a theatrical feature , it's next-to-impossible to make an effective adaptation . rose's brave-but-disappointing attempt reinforces this belief . the storyline for anna karenina is widely-known , so i won't spend much time recapping it here . rose's boldest stroke in this version is to leave in the kitty/levin subplot , rather than excising it ( which is what happens in most adaptations ) . while retaining levin's story provides the overall tale with greater balance and depth , it eats up valuable time and dilutes the focus . what works in the book doesn't necessarily succeed on screen , and the result is a choppy and uneven motion picture . character development is almost nonexistent as time pressure forces rose to push on without giving the audience an opportunity to digest what's happening or get into the protagonists' heads . there are times when anna karenina seems not like a filmed version of the cliffnotes , but of the abridged cliffnotes . i have several casting quibbles , as well . french actress sophie marceau ( braveheart ) is a cool , regal beauty -- not the right type at all to play the hot-blooded , passionate anna . marceau is a good actress , but she's wrong for this role , and her icy rendering of anna leaves viewers largely unconcerned about the fate of the character . kirshner's north american accent is out- of-place , and molina never properly captures levin's deep-rooted melancholy . despite the problems with story , characterization , and acting , anna karenina is far from a complete bust . visually , it's nothing less than stunning ( with outside locations filmed in russia ) -- the most eye- catching motion picture since kenneth branagh's hamlet . ballroom interiors , landscapes , and even close-ups of faces leave the viewer entranced . at one point during the movie , when karenin remarks , "" there's so much splendor here . one's eyes are bedazzled , "" he might have been talking about the look of the film . the soundtrack , which features the work of tchaikovsky , rachmaninoff , and prokofiev , is equally arresting . had the script for anna karenina matched the production values , this movie would have been a rousing success , but that's not the case . once , near the very end , as a broken vronsky reflects on what has transpired , the movie finally allows us to feel for a character , but , as the saying goes , it's too little , too late . leo tolstoy's anna karenina has its good points , but there's nothing here to warrant such an extravagant remake . for anyone who really wants to enjoy the story , with its rich characters , stimulating ideas , and wrenching tragedy , a copy of the paperback book should cost about as much as a movie ticket , and will provide a more lasting and worthwhile investment .",JBe
"for reasons that probably have more to do with money than art , hollywood has decided to remake the 1954 french thriller les diaboliques . this time it is a hopelessly muddled mess called simply diabolique , which isn't very simple at all for american audiences i guess since the guy in front of me at the box office at local multiplex said "" give me two tickets to that show with the strange name .

"there are plenty of strange , ironic and otherwise inexplicable things about hollywood filmmaking in the 1990s , but among the more puzzling is the way it treats "" star power . "" in the glory days of the studio system , hollywood packaged stars together in whatever material was available at the time , always conscious of the fact that audiences would come out to see certain actors do little more than model wardrobe . plenty of films exist primarily to be glossy star packages , but the studios treat that fact as a dirty little secret . in these post-modern , indie-hip cinematic times of ours , it has become unfashionable to admit that sometimes we just like to see attractive people doing attractive things . that's the only explanation for the thomas crown affair , a star package so overwhelmingly glossy you may need to shield your eyes from the glare . the thomas crown affair follows in the fine tradition of the original 1968 version , which itself existed largely as a star vehicle for steve mcqueen and faye dunaway . the scenery , from the nightspots of the manhattan jet set to the tropical islands to which that set jets , is lovingly photographed . director john mctiernan steps back from die hard-style pacing to establish a moderate , almost jazzy tempo for the too-cool characters and situations . brosnan , who probably emerged from the womb in a freshly pressed tuxedo , squints in a manly fashion ; russo , attempting to do for women's underwear what clark gable did for t-shirts , does the little black dress thing with slinky appeal . teflon should only be this slick . plenty of viewers will undoubtedly find themselves carried away by this fantasia for beautiful people . i might even have been among them if the thomas crown affair hadn't grown so angst-y and redundant . it's an early signal that the film is going to play the "" sure , they're beautiful people , but they've got feelings too "" card . it's entertaining enough to watch as crown and banning circle each other , each one thinking he or she is the manipulator rather than the manipulatee . russo plays the final half hour with such overwrought gravity that you'd think her decision whether or not to turn crown in made her hamlet to his polonius . i find myself in an awkward position as i criticize the thomas crown affair , because ultimately i fault it for trying to work in some subtext . plenty of films could use a healthy injection of subtext , mind you -- or the vaugest hint of a text , even -- but this film isn't one of them . it fairly screams out to be treated as a caper , with crown and banning spending their time trying to out-think each other rather than out-emote each other . there's just too much earnestness to the way they play it . by trying to play a 1940s story with 1990s emotional realism , the filmmakers miss the fantasy we're looking for when we watch two movie stars together in a movie that , ultimately , is about two movie stars together . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .",SRe
"screenplay : lee david zlotoff . director : lee david zlotoff . maybe they smelled a female-appeal hit like fried green tomatoes ; maybe they liked the idea of countering the hollywood filth-monger mentality by supporting a film produced by clergy ; maybe , just maybe , they were genuinely touched by the story . whatever the reason , they have themselves a film which doesn't just jerk tears -- it slaps , kicks , pinches and pleads for them . the spitfire grill may be positive and uplifting , but it is so aggressive in the pursuit of your sympathy that it becomes exhausting . on its most basic level , the spitfire grill is yet another in a long line of films about benevolent strangers who teach intransigent folks a lesson in tolerance , and again the lead character is perhaps the most troubled , but not really the character who grows and changes . she is the sympathetic core of the film , and we grow to care about whether she will be able to find redemption . unfortunately , we never get to see her experience that redemption , and it is something of a cheat . it is never nearly as important to us that hannah makes peace with her demons , or that nahum learns to be accepting , or that any particular person ends up with the grill , but those are the only scraps we are tossed to give the spitfire grill any sense of consequence . in place of consequence , writer/director lee david zlotoff provides a film which often feels like a string of feel-good cliches , scored by james horner , the master of feel-good cliche music . zlotoff never misses the opportunity to send out scenes like tear-seeking missiles , scenes which might have been effective individually but en masse serve only to batter you insensible . if my description seems cruelly cynical , it is only because the spitfire grill numbs you with its pathos . in its own way , it is just as shallow as an action film which is just one explosion after another . the story goes that the spitfire grill was "" commissioned "" by a collective of catholic priests who wanted to back a film with "" positive human values , "" and i suppose you could say that they got what they ordered . everyone in gilead eventually does the right thing , and it is the kind of film which will probably end up on bob dole's hit parade . but in the course of injecting those human values , lee david zlotoff didn't bother to inject many human beings -- gilead , maine and nearly everyone in it ( particularly the terminally irrascible hannah ) seems plucked from a pepperidge farm commercial . alison elliott's performance is strong enough that , for a while , you might think the spitfire grill is about something , but it isn't about people whose troubles make you emotional . it's more of an endurance contest between you and your supply of facial tissues .",SRe
"screenplay : winnie holzman . producers : penney finkelman cox , tom rosenberg , alan poul . director : scott winant . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( profanity , adult themes ) running time : 110 minutes . as the opening minutes of 'til there was you unfolded , i was fully prepared to despise it for continuing the sleepless in seattle-ization of the romantic comedy genre . the success of nora ephron's 1993 paean to celestially-destined love may be the worst thing ever to happen to film romance -- what incentive is there to create a plot or characters which make sense if you can explain everything away as "" fate ? "" then it became clear that 'til there was you wasn't falling into the sleepless trap . in fact , it was consciously subverting it . and suddenly i was even more depressed that the film i was watching was so painfully tedious . here was the love story i had been waiting for , and it turned out to be an uninvolving , maudlin and incoherent mess . i'm sure that director scott winant and writer winnie holzman thought they were on to something fairly clever when they came up to the concept for 'til there was you , and in theory they were right . it's a wonderfully practical kind of romanticism 'til there was you offers : the idea that true love is the product of two people who meet at a moment when they are both _ready_ for true love . that's the sturdy skeleton of the story , however , not the dead body of a film which was made with it . 'til there was you is all the things the detractors of those shows most detested , without nearly enough of the balancing wit and attention to detail which gave the shows such a devoted following . the two hours of 'til there was you could inspire a lot of watch-checking as it becomes a rambling parade of over-wrought situations and annoying characters , with gwen's picturesque apartment complex -- a cross between melrose place and the garden district where it is perpetually raining rose petals -- becoming more of a recurring joke than a location . the fatal flaw comes with the casting of the romantic leads , and for once the problem isn't that they don't belong together . you're just not likely to care one way or the other . jeanne tripplehorn demonstrates a nice flair for light comedy , but the pleasant-if-kooky character she plays isn't nearly interesting enough to support the story . nick is a complete blank for most of the film , and his sudden conversion from sullen architectural dadaist to lover of all things poetic and ornate makes virtually no sense . thank heaven sarah jessica parker is on hand as the endearingly narcissistic francesca , providing a burst of energy whenever she's in a scene . 'til there was you needs much more of that energy to match its good intentions , instead of 110 minutes of nearly oppressive sincerity . the struggles of real-life relationships don't have to be this dreary , but when they are , the appeal of starry-eyed hokum like sleepless in seattle suddenly makes a lot more sense .",SRe
"there is no question that one has to be careful about the good taste required when making a so-called comedy film about the holocaust , not to offend those who have suffered enough already , but that proves to be no problem here , as benigni went to some jewish organizations prior to shooting the film and got their blessings for this project . besides , i don't think there are any sacred subjects that can't be touched , it is , ultimately , the quality of the film itself that counts . and if there is another reason for not disapproving offhand the film's comic handling of this horrific context , then let's bring up the example of charlie chaplin in the the great dictator , though not directly about the holocaust , nevertheless , it was a light comedic parody of "" the fuehrer "" , and it was considered by many , not only to be an appropriate film , but one of the all time great films . the later part of the assessment of that film , is in recognition of that film's tremendous power to satirize nazism . benigni's film just can't muster that same power , because it has muddled and sanitized its telling of the story too much , as well-intentioned , as he might have been in trying to tell the story , the power in the telling of it is just not there . what is there , are bits and pieces of the holocaust's human story , that is as horrific a story as any one can imagine , and offers some contribution to understanding the affects of the holocaust . what he just doesn't make clear , is that the italian fascists were part of the "" final solution . "" benigni's film offers no explanation for this . life is beautiful , is the line trotsky said , before he was about to be assassinated , serves as the rosy title for such a downbeat subject , that is played in a hearfelt and sincere manner , even though , what it offers for nazi atrocities is for the most part the mildly anti-septic kind , reminding me of stalag 17 , or hogan's heroes tv series where the nazis are pictured as cartoon buffoons . having a horse painted green , marked as a jewish horse , makes for a colorful scene and segue to elopement for guido ( benigni ) and dora ( braschi ) , but in no way begins to symbolize or explore the deep rooted hatred that would lead to a policy of genocide . to find such truths , go way beyond the scope of this comedy star vehicle , which , instead , uses this serious subject matter for benigni to contrast his charlie chaplin like routines with the threat of genocide that is ominous , while following a story line that will not try to offend anyone , probably not even the nazis , that much , especially since benigni calls this story a fable , giving him an excuse to invent what he wants for the film . let me tell you , the holocaust was no fable . but yet , because the subject matter is so deadly serious , he is , at least , able to reach a more general audience , drawn to see such a film they would have most likely not seen , but see it because of benigni's comic ability , and in the process , he has vouchsafed for them how insane the world's prejudice against jews has been , as he makes the film's efforts seem worthy enough , even if that were all this film would accomplish , that would be plenty . but i believe he does accomplish more , but he does it , by distorting history , until , in the end , he does show the horror and tragedy of the holocaust , in his own inimical way . in the first part of the film , if you did not know that benigni's guido was jewish , you certainly couldn't tell , since he just seemed like he was an eccentric , motor-mouth italian . so , in that sense , this film in a round-about way , is erasing that stereotyped prejudice some people might still have about jews being so different from others . i was not offended by seeing comedy routines take place in a concentration camp ; i also was not touched as i should have been with the gravity of the situation , due to the comic effects . and if any one in their right mind thought that by playing some silly child game in a concentration camp they could survive , i got a surprise for them , it ain't so . the book that gave me a very truthful and precisely frank look at the daily lives of those in such predicaments , is the one by the italian chemist and former concentration survivor , primo levi , whose autobiographical , "" i survived auschwitz , "" shows what it really was like in those camps . that book touched me , even more than the truest film to date that i saw about the holocaust , shoah , did . after you read that book , there can be no illusions that you are in for a game in the park when you are interred in such a camp . though the italian jews had it easier than the others brought to the camp , because they came there pretty near the end of the war and therefore were not subjected to long torturous years of suffering , nevertheless , it was a place where the survivors looked like skeletons and felt as if they were already dead . the film is really made up of two parts , each with a very different feel to it . for most of this part of the film we don't even know if he is jewish , until we see the green horse and , later on , see the sign on his bookstore saying this is a jewish place , since he seems to be in some denial mode of what is really going on around him . amid a whole bag full of slapstick jokes , which probably never go out of style , since the audience where i watched the film , howled with uncontrollable laughter at all the corny bits , leaving me to wonder why i can't muster a laugh . there must be something funny about this physical humor , after all , there is a long line of vaudeville comedians who made people laugh for generations doing those schticks . i guess , this kind of comedy is just not my cup of tea , and if others find it funny and because of it , find the film endearing , then it is just a question of differing tastes . though , quite frankly , i did think most of the bits were embarrassingly crass ; for instance , those contrived scenes where he keeps bumping into his future wife , and the switching of hats ; and , the egg- in- the- face routine , i found to be especially tedious , since i find him to be more energetic and a master of good timing than outright funny . but , i also , must say , the first part of the film was easy to watch , it seemed to have a smooth and even flow to it . it's too bad she can't act , but then again , this is basically a one man show , so really , she just becomes another one of his props , much like a leading lady in a marx bros . movie is used , as a diversion to balance their comedy routines . this material is shamelessly old hat , it is only effusive because the star is so frenetic and nimble and manipulative on screen . but there were also some clever bits , like his speech , though not original , it still hit the mark , as he pretended to be a school official , giving a talk on racial superiority to elementary students where dora teaches , using his body as an example of all his superior fascist parts , such as his belly button , which is a good fascist one . this game idea could probably work for as long as a train ride from italy to germany , but for anyone to think it could work inside the camp , that would be ludicrous on their part to think so . the jews in the camp looked so well fed , that it was hard to believe that they were in a concentration camp . everyone else said their lines in a flat monotone voice that projected bad acting and because of that , almost made a mockery out of their roles . naturally the comedy routines did not work inside the camp , except for the bit where guido translates the rules of the camp for the german guards , as he makes it seem to the kid that what he is reading are the rules for the game they are playing , as he explains that the guards are only acting mean because they are part of the game . no one laughed in the audience , but this was funny in a way that you wouldn't laugh out loud funny . some slapstick was tried , such as guido's comically high stepping walk , but that got no laughs . but mostly , for this part of the film , the emphasis became on this game he was playing for his kid's sake , his love was so great for him , that he would do anything to save his life . audiences could relate to that , and that cleverly became the focal and selling point of the film . that is primarily why this film won an oscar for best foreign film , its comedy alone would not have been enough . the film , to its ever lasting credit , was able to clearly depict jews as human beings , not as objects to be reduced to soap or buttons , more human than the nazis , who have disqualified themselves from being a civilized regime by their inhumanity . this where i think life is beautful succeeded most , is being a film that inadvertly , without probably really being fully aware of what it was doing , showed how unprepared the jews were for this tragedy by being in a state of denial . which is one of the reasons why the holocaust is such a touchy subject , and one has to be careful about how one presents it to others , lest one forgets its dire consequences . and as unbelievable as it may seem , life is beautful , somehow or other , caught an interesting aspect of the holocaust , with an original take on how passive the jews were , something few films really make a major point of , for one reason or another . did the film do enough to show the horrors of genocide ? for some people it evidently did enough to leave them beguiled by the improbable mix of comedy and a holocaust . the uniqueness and likability of this film , is that benigni exploits his comic talents to take advantage of a very difficult situation , using comedy as a weapon . but this is most definetly an example of the rewriting of history , by seeing the holocaust as if it could almost be perceived as comical and not quite real , as a fable , depending on the audience itself to know fully well what happened , where only by the very end of the film , is there a realization that something terrible has happened and a tear could be shed , does a disservice to how history and the victims of it look at it and fails to recognize how little people not directly involved with the holocaust actually know about it . there is a reason why films are popular , and that reason is that people want to see what they like on screen , they as a rule , do not like to think about things that are unpleasant to them , and this film has deftly and arbitrarily accomplished that by skimming the surface off all the horrible things they could have seen , instead , it subtly goes about its business by hiding from the audience what really happened to the jews in those camps by not showing how real their plight was . this film seemed almost like it was primarily a very personal film about a father's love for his family and his great sacrifice for them , rather than a holocaust film per se . that the world is still filled with hatred , filled with other genocide campaigns , and not filled with enough people throughout the world with enough courage to put a stop to this attitude , is as plain as day . i still think that most of the world is at a low stage of the evolutionary scale and ready to do a nazi-style thing all over , if given the chance , just check out the recent serbian-kosovo conflict for affirmation that ethnic cleansing has not gone away with the end of nazism . so what can a film do ? probably , all it can do is show what really happened , and it doesn't matter if its method is drama , comedy , or even a musical , as long as it is meaningful . i intend to be very critically tolerant of this film and say , that even though it struck me as a rather thin holocaust story , it is still a worthwhile film for those who don't want or can't handle the heavier stuff , and are not put off by the comedy . they will find , if they look hard enough and look past what miramax promoted for its own purposes so it could win the oscar , a film that is more complex than it appears at first glance . but they will also find , that it is a film that still makes it evident , that the world still is in denial of what really happened , and can only look at the holocaust in a rather superficial way , even after all these years . there is still an element of world guilt , that because of that , will so highly reward this film with honors , even if the film has shown that it cannot open up both its eyes to see how real the holocaust was . but , i guess , we should thank benigni for at least opening up one eye , and letting us see that both his film's take on the holocaust and most of the world's take on the holocaust , is still bonded by denial about how they view the holocaust , which is the same mistake the italian jews made when they denied the obvious , what was right in front of their noses , until it was too late .",DSc
"jane austen's mafia , sometimes marketed more simply as mafia ! , is a comedic retelling of the godfather saga . with many of the sets made to look identical to the movie series it spoofs , the film has jokes that work best for those familiar with the godfather movies , but the humor is so broadly written that people who have forgotten the coppola films will still get it . in his last film role before his death , bridges looks tired and miscast . to be fair , the gags he is given , like getting stuck in the venetian blinds , are not much to work with . the script uses a series of sight gags that work at first , but the movie , heavy on the flatulence jokes , soon runs out of its own gas . during the first thirty minutes , the writers , jim abrahams , greg norberg and michael mcmanus , use one ridiculous gag after another to send the audience reeling . as the story gets longer , the jokes get staler and the writers fall back on gross-out humor like the world's biggest vomiting scene . most of the movie , however , is silly fun . when one joke , like spaghetti on a stick , doesn't work , the writers toss the audience a barrage of other gags in the hopes that something will strike the viewers' fancy . ( the filmmakers even had fun with the press by sending out two press kits . the first one had a cover in english , but the text was in italian . some of the best jokes are funny partly because they are so crude that you are embarrassed to be laughing . sounds ridiculous and is , but the director stages it with so much outlandish panache that the scene generated guffaws from the whole theater . and still others , as the guy who threw craps at the dice table by throwing a pair of , well , you guessed it , left our audience just staring . most of the dialog is not up to the physical humor but there are some funny lines .

"screenplay : john sayles . director : john sayles . this is how far i trust john sayles' skill as a writer : in the few hours after i saw lone star , when i couldn't quite get the pieces to fit together , i figured _i_ had to be missing something . perhaps more than any other filmmaker's next project , i look forward to the next john sayles project like a christmas gift . while he is still growing as a director , his scripts are so unapologetically and relentlessly literate -- and literary -- that unwrapping them is its own kind of pleasure . lone star , as much as any film of the last several years , is a novel on the screen , and a marvelous one . when i finally did put those pieces together , i realized how justified my faith had been . on its most basic level , lone star is a superbly acted study of life in a border town . the cast is uniformly in tune with sayles' naturalistic style , particularly chris cooper in a subtle but powerful performance as sam ; even frances mcdormand , as sam's manic-depressive ex-wife , lends humanity to an edgy role in her single scene . the multi-ethnic cast provides a solid foundation for an examination of a place where the "" melting pot "" is anything but . it is a place which , while less overtly racist than it was during charley wade's reign in the 1950s , is still characterized by an omnipresent sense of "" us "" and "" them .

"the crown jewel of 1995's summer blockbusters appears to have arrived early . it's hard to imagine any motion picture released between now and august matching mel gibson's braveheart for spectacle . with its clashing armies , heartstopping action , and grand sense of romance , this is the sort of film it's a pleasure to see and review . let me state my preferences up front . i'm a big fan of the epic adventure , a category in which braveheart , like cream , rises to the top . there's a lot in this film that's praiseworthy--not the least of which is its ambition . those viewing this picture may be easily reminded of gettysburg , the last of the mohicans , glory , and such classics as lawrence of arabia , el cid , and spartacus . the grandeur is certainly present ; nevertheless , gibson gives us not only memorable battles , but characters of real substance . borrowing from masters like sam peckinpah and david lean , the actor/director has crafted an exceptional cinematic tapestry in only his sophomore effort . most of the time , three hour movies have a few flat spots , but braveheart is constantly on the move--riveting from start to finish . when the end credits began to roll , i was hard pressed to accept that nearly 170 minutes had elapsed . the title character is william wallace ( gibson ) , a hero of scottish history whose legend has surely outstripped fact ( in its own unique way , the film acknowledges this ) . braveheart builds slowly to its first gritty climax . their courtship is unhurried , yet this is all preparation . patrick henry once said , "" give me liberty , or give me death ! "" that might well be wallace's motto . "" it's all for nothing if you don't have freedom ! "" bulked up and wearing a long-haired wig , gibson brings his usual wealth of charisma to the title role . his edward the longshanks exudes an aura of cold menace . he's a worthy foe for wallace because his intelligence matches his ruthlessness . sophie marceau , the french actress who plays princess isabelle , and catherine mccormack are both immensely appealing . braveheart is a brutal , bloody motion picture , but the violence is not gratuitous . the maimings , decapitations , and other assorted gruesome details make wallace's world seem real and immediate . in addition , few theatrical moments make a more eloquent statement against war than when gibson shows women and children weeping over the dead on a body-littered battlefield . war is a two-headed beast , and both faces--the glorious and the tragic--are depicted . lately , certain films have come in pairs : two robin hoods , two columbuses , two earps , and now two highlander epics . rob roy , the first , is a fine motion picture . braveheart , however , is better , offering an exhilarating , and occasionally touching , experience that has viewers leaving the theater caught up in an afterglow of wonder . these days , heros like william wallace are as rare as motion picture displays of this high , uncompromising quality .",JBe
"i love trouble is a perfect example of a truly lightweight motion picture . with its preposterous plot and mtv-like camerawork , this movie survives--and occasionally even thrives--on the likeability of its performers and the unexpectedly frothy chemistry between them . this is a watchable film for those who don't expect or demand much from their summer entertainment . taking this film at face value , one might be tempted to say that the mystery elements are merely plot devices around which to build the peterson/brackett relationship . this certainly seems to be the case early on . however , somewhere along the way , screenwriters meyers and shyer apparently decided that they had the makings of a decent thriller on their hands . as a result , far too much time is spent expanding upon an element of the plot that makes very little sense and has almost no audience appeal . i love trouble ends up being about 30 minutes too long . the last half-hour especially drags , as the interaction between brackett and peterson is curtailed in favor of shoot-outs , chases , and a lot of idiotic exposition . we have yet another example of a villain holding a hero at gunpoint and gleefully explaining his entire crime . when i love trouble is focusing on the interplay between nolte and roberts , it's generally enjoyable , despite some atrocious dialogue . a lot of the so-called "" witty repartee "" between the two principals ends up sounding horribly contrived . they're like bogart and becall or tracy and hepburn sparring with each other good-naturedly , sexual tension crackling between them . stick a pair of mismatched , marginal performers in the roles of brackett and peterson , and i love trouble might have been very , very bad . nolte rarely gives a subpar performance , and this is no exception as he lends the full force of his not inconsiderable talent into playing brackett . julia roberts generally does her best work in lighter roles ( even though it has elements of a thriller/mystery , i love trouble is , at heart , a romantic comedy ) , and her peterson proves an apt foil for brackett . the pair work well together , regardless of what they're doing or saying , and it's a credit to them both that they're able to overcome so many of the script's faults and still keep the audience interested . alas , screen charisma and chemistry can only get you so far , and that's the problem with this sort of film . the dubious premise is not well-executed , and the final product too often emphasizes its weaknesses rather than its strengths . the sad truth is that whenever i love trouble relies on something other than its two stars , it's in trouble .",JBe
"in la femme nikita , writer/director luc besson proved his capability of putting as much octane and adrenaline into a thriller as any american director while keeping his formula uniquely non-hollywood . much the same is true of the professional , which has sequences to rival those of speed for white-knuckle excitement--not to mention a plot that's equally as preposterous . although not well-founded in reality , these two characters mesh nicely . despite an occasional low-key hint of sexual attraction , this is basically a father/daughter or mentor/apprentice relationship . there's nothing unique about a young girl melting the heart of a hardened loner except the manner in which besson approaches the theme . he does more with mannerisms and body language than with facial expressions , and the closer he is drawn to mathilda , the more uncomfortable he appears . the less traditional role belongs to an impressive natalie portman , yet another member of the highly-talented , recent group of youthful actors . there are likely some viewers who will be disturbed by mathilda's predilection for profanity . because of the non-american flavor brought to this film by besson , the professional is anything but typical fare . it is stylish , darkly humorous , and almost artsy in its approach to the genre . nevertheless , it delivers what viewers want from any thriller : lots of action . with some surprisingly strong character interaction , there's a lot to like about this movie , at least for those willing to look beyond all the bloodshed . at one point , leon comments to an attentive mathilda that "" the closer you get to being a pro , the closer you can get to the client .

"" this turns out to be another preposterous flick of his , but with the trappings that it has something more to say about the evil in the world than all the violence it pours onto the screen . the film has lots of expensive gadgets to work with , and they are used as explosives and as gimmicks to fill in for the words that stop making sense after a while . there are the usual betrayals and twists in such a story , the maddening conclusion to the hostage situation , and a dubious ending that is slickly done . with such a dark delineation of morals exhibited by all sides , who cares who wins ! this film is about exploding all the toys the big-budget allowed for and keeping the action frenetic and the sex as tawdry as possible . the acting was dreary . hugh jackman's performance was particularly rancid . john travolta thinks he's houdini , but he seems more like a guy getting good money for playing a part that required little acting skills other than to just look sinister and smile occasionally . this "" swordfish "" has a smell to it , like it's not fresh . but if you're looking for crass summertime entertainment , this dish of "" swordfish "" can please those who have a very tolerant palate .",DSc
"it never ceases to amaze me how badly a poor script can screw up a potentially fascinating premise . the theatrical and television previews make this film look like a clever thriller centered around this dilemma . but , as is often the case , that's because such advertisements use only the best scenes . left out are numerous instances of overacting , underacting , terrible dialogue , and poor plotting . despite a compelling basis for its story , jordan katz and heywood gould's screenplay vacillates between the contrived and the downright moronic . the characters are strictly one-dimensional types engaging in flat , stilted conversations . melodrama suffuses several potentially-taut sequences , and the conclusion would be right at home in such films as basic instinct . his often-magnetic ( and never subdued ) presence only makes you aware of what this film might have been had a more competent production team taken charge . for whatever reason , grasping valerie's psyche seems beyond the actress ( or maybe she just didn't care enough ) , and she comes across as stale . kenneth branagh's dead again took a dopey premise and built a solid , entertaining plot around it . even as an homage to '40s film noir flicks , it's woeful . you need more than joanne whalley-kilmer doing a rita hayworth impersonation to accomplish that . quentin tarantino's much-awaited second feature won't be in theaters for another two months . after all , the script for this film is nothing if not pulp fiction .",JBe
"directors : kirk wise and gary trousdale . as i sat in my car twenty minutes after the conclusion of the hunchback of notre dame , tears still welling up in my eyes , i though about what made me respond to disney's recent animated hits , even flawed efforts like pocahontas . it was not simply animation to which i was responding , since animated films like balto had left me unmoved , and i like to believe that disney's ubiquitous marketing had no influence . i thought about the moments in films like beauty and the beast and the little mermaid which had filled me with the pure joy of film artistry , and i realized the connection : music . the hunchback of notre dame is dark , enchanting , visually spectacular and richer in thematic depth than 99% of the live action films i see , but i know that it was the power of grand opera which pushed me over the edge . there is no question that computer technology is allowing disney animators an ever-increasing freedom , and the opportunity to create some astonishing images . there are scenes involving thousands of "" extras "" which are simply extraordinary , and a swooping shot as quasimodo comes to esmeralda's rescue which is breath-taking . still , the conventional character animation might be even better . it seems almost unfair to single out one star , but i will : kathy zielinski , the character supervisor for frollo . she has designed one of disney's most complicated villains ever , a tormented and hateful zealot with a mouth so cruel and subtly expressive that he makes you want to shudder every time he smiles . with superb voice work by tony jay , frollo becomes a brilliant characterization . if an animator ever deserved credit for a best supporting actor performance , this might be the case . frollo's tortured soul ( revealed in a creepy and very un-disney-like song called "" hellfire "" ) is just one of many rather adult subjects which gives hunchback a surprising resonance . quasimodo's cowering respect for frollo is heart-breaking , rendered poignantly by tom hulce . there is certainly a fair amount of comic relief , mostly provided by the gargoyles and the lively number "" a guy like you , "" but if hunchback is at all a film for children , it is one which exposes them to issues their parents should be prepared to discuss . the messages in hunchback are powerful , and they are skillfully handled , but there is something that happens when they are set to music . the songs by alan menken and steven schwartz are not particularly memorable by disney standards , nothing you will be humming for days afterwards like "" be our guest "" or "" under the sea , "" but they are evocative . a heartfelt sentiment which is sung rather than spoken draws its emotion from a different place . hollywood seems to believe that no one wants to see a musical in 1996 , and that disney's films are aberrations because they are animated . i'm not convinced that the real issue isn't choice of material . disney selects timeless tales , and a timeless tale in song is a powerful thing . there are certainly more than a few similarities between the hunchback of notre dame and beauty and the beast ( also directed by kirk wise and gary trousdale ) ; if it had been live action , i'd have sworn that they re-used some of the same sets in the opening number . beauty and the beast is a better film , a classic , and yet there i was , twenty minutes after the conclusion of hunchback , tears still welling up in my eyes , emotionally invested in the life of an animated character . and though the songs may not have been on my lips , i know they were in my heart .",SRe
"the piano is a film about passion , the most basic and primal element of human nature . no matter how thick the veneer of civilization is , or how deeply-buried beneath layers of social repression those latent emotions are , passion ultimately cannot be denied . this is something that the three principals of this movie learn in various , not-always-pleasant , ways . the piano has powerful emotional themes resonating through it , all dealing with the release of repressed passion . jane campion's story is often stirring and occasionally gut-wrenching ; the latter perhaps to a fault . there is a single visceral scene in this movie which becomes the most stark and enduring image taken from the theater . while definitely an expression of passion , this is perhaps not intended as the single defining moment of the piano , although it may be remembered as such . symbolism abounds , and most of it is clear enough for even the casual viewer to grasp . stewart's rejection of this , like baines' acceptance , defines the basis of who he is . the final scenes of the piano abound with symbols , the recognition of which will help in understanding all the facets of the ending . the three main actors give dazzling performances . to be able to convey this much energy and emotion without ever speaking a word ( except in a pair of short voiceovers ) requires someone of astonishing talent and ability . hunter's ada is every bit as powerful a presentation as anthony hopkins' stevens in the remains of the day . harvey keitel is as good , although the complexities of his character don't allow for quite as obvious a standout performance . sam neill has the most incomplete material to work from , but he does all he can with stewart . like their adult counterparts , child actors come with varying ranges of ability . while not in the category of a valentina scalici ( from il ladro di bambini , and who i have stated is the best child performer i have ever seen ) , ms . paquin is ultimately believable in her role , and a great asset to the film . as good as ms . campion's basic story is , both characterization and technical presentation are lacking . taken in tandem , these flaws prevent the piano from attaining its full potential . stewart never attains three-dimensionality , despite sam neill's best attempts , and baines is occasionally little more than a sounding board for ada's emotions to reverberate off of . flora's personality undergoes a radical shift that , at best , is only partially-motivated by what we see on screen . the editing of the piano is choppy , at times causing the narrative to seem disjointed or confusing . more than one transition is jarringly abrupt . there were several instances when my connection with the film was broken because of this . it's odd that , with a name like the piano , one of the weaknesses is the score . there are instances when michael nyman's themes are inappropriate for the scenes where they are used , and it has been pointed out to me that the new age strains coming from ada's instrument have no place during the time period in which the piano is supposed to have taken place . the piano is a good film with a potent message and occasional splashes of genius , but it is not remarkable experience , except perhaps where holly hunter's performance is concerned . while it's true that individuals will attribute different importance to the various flaws , there exists the distinct possibility that those going to see the piano with the expectation of watching the best movie of the year , will leave the theater disappointed .",JBe

"screenplay : christopher mcquarrie . director : christopher mcquarrie . mpaa rating : r ( violence , profanity , adult themes ) running time : 119 minutes . the way of the gun -- the directing debut by oscar-winning screenwriter christopher mcquarrie ( the usual suspects ) -- opens the way you always hope a film will open : with so much energy and potential that the whole theater seems electrified . the scene is violent , profane , surprising and hilarious . as a tone-setter , it's marvelous ; as a stand-alone piece of writing and directing , it's hella-fun . filled with individual moments of loopy creativity , genuinely unsettling violence and wicked dialogue , the way of the gun should have been one of the best films of the year ( though in a painfully lackluster 2000 , it still has a shot at that dubious honor ) . the only reason it's not is a fundamental narrative miscalculation on mcquarrie's part : there's no good reason for parker and longbaugh to be the film's ostensible protagonists . for at least the first half-hour , the way of the gun is so skillfully rendered that it seems destined for glory . from parker and longbaugh's torment of a clerk at a sperm bank , to the unconventional staging of the kidnapping itself , to the splendid slow-speed chase that follows , mcquarrie twists the crime caper genre 90 degrees at virtually every opportunity . even playing the tarantino comparison card doesn't entirely do justice to mcquarrie's ability to throw a wrench into expectations . the connections between the characters become evident only after a bit of reflection ; there's no guarantee that bad-asses still won't get their bad asses kicked , or that those who appear likely to take the most punishment might not end up dishing it out . it's almost never exactly what you expect it to be . and , in at least one case , that's not exactly a compliment . mcquarrie , however , never seems aware of that fact . telling the story largely from their perspective isn't a celebration of the anti-hero ; it's a narrative blunder . is that blunder enough to throw the way of the gun entirely off course ? fortunately not . mcquarrie's compositions are unusually rich for a writer-turned-director -- watch for mrs . chidduck appearing in the background and at the edge of the frame -- yet he still ends on a kicker of a line of dialogue . the only thing missing from the way of the gun is soul , the soul that would have been provided by sarno as its center . it's a good film that's a 90 degree twist away from greatness -- the one 90 degree twist mcquarrie didn't take . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .",SRe
"date released : 6/24/94 running length : 3 : 09 rated : pg-13 ( violence , mature themes , language , sexual situations ) kevin costner is fast becoming hollywood's "" three-plus hour "" actor . not many movies these days have close to that sort of running time , and wyatt earp shows why . although epic in length and scope , it is not epic in depth and , upon occasion , that can make this a tedious experience . the historical accuracy of lawrence kasdan's film isn't much of an issue , at least as far as i'm concerned . the writer/director intertwines fact with myth to create what is , for the most part , a reasonably entertaining story , and freely admits a certain degree of "" fictionalization "" where his characters and situations are concerned . there's a lot of apparently unnecessary padding that might have looked good on the scripted page , but doesn't come across nearly as well on the big screen . the first hour rambles , presenting disjointed scenes that fail to add much depth to any of the characters . wyatt's courting of and marriage to urilla ( annabeth gish ) happens so quickly that it fails to provoke much emotional reaction . for the early portions of the movie , wyatt is not an especially interesting person . only after establishing wyatt's "" good "" and "" evil "" sides in this obvious and time- consuming manner does kasdan allow the two to merge into the more complex and interesting character who arrives to clean up dodge city . tombstone is rightfully at the center of wyatt earp , and it isn't surprising that it's the most interesting segment of the film . the buildup to the gunfight at the ok corral is intense and energetic , and the execution isn't a letdown . subsequent events are handled with equal flair and , although the ending is muddled , there's a wonderfully tense and atmospheric sequence involving a nighttime shoot-out around a stopped train . following an impressive performance in a perfect world , kevin costner is back to merely "" adequate . "" most of the time , costner's attempts to present wyatt's icy demeanor make the character flat and uninteresting . some of the dumb dialogue doesn't help , but he's not the only actor saddled with occasionally-stilted lines . as wyatt's father nicholas , gene hackman doesn't have much screen time , and he appears to be on hand mostly to pick up a paycheck - this is easily the actor's least-inspired performance in years . dennis quaid delivers a delightful turn as doc holliday . this incarnation of the consumption-stricken dentist mixes a sly , self-deprecating wit with a cold , calculated viciousness . most of the other cast members are fine in their roles . wyatt earp is visually impressive , but that's no big surprise . any western , and certainly any would-be epic , has to boast a good cinematographer ( in this case , it's owen roizman ) . the musical score is marginally less effective . although composer james newton howard seemingly attempts to recapture the mood of dances with wolves , the last of the mohicans , and gettysburg , his themes aren't as memorable . because of its recent release , tombstone comparisons are inevitable . the biggest advantage the late-1993 film has over this one is length ( tombstone clocks in at 2 : 08 ) , but that's about it . wyatt earp's script is less confusing , the characters are better developed , and the acting is a notch higher . despite his two-note performance , costner is more believable as the title character than kurt russell , and quaid's version of doc holliday is more chilling than val kilmer's . joanna going manages to bring a certain sparkle to josie marcus that is missing from dana delaney's interpretation . in much the same way that chaplin overextends itself by trying to present a complete picture of the actor's life , wyatt earp's attempts to cover so many years lead to too many scenes with little emotional power . the film doesn't shoot blanks , and it is better than tombstone but , considering the names involved , a little disappointment isn't out of the question .",JBe

"" needless to say , rudy and deck jump for joy at receiving such valuable evidence as this unequivocal letter . after a slow start the movie takes off dramatically once it gets to the courtroom . an ex-civil rights attorney , judge kipler is played with just the right level of restrained humor by danny glover .

"belle de jour is a classic french film from 1967 that has been out of release for a couple of decades . belle de jour is by the famous director luis bunuel and stars the equally famous catherine deneuve as severine sevigny . her bouts of prostitution again feature s & m which is attempted to be presented as great fun and very playful . for anyone wanting a more serious treatment of prostitution , they should see the excellent , albeit quite depressing , 1986 movie working girls by lizzie borden . i'll let you find out the rest of the story by seeing the movie . i found the story unbelievable and very dated . i know the critics are going gaga over its rerelease . i do not buy it . she looks pretty degraded and unhappy to me even though she does start to smile some toward the end of the film . i thought the performance of all the actors , most especially that of deneuve , was wooden . it was as if the director wanted more of a tableaux that a motion picture . to the fans of this show , i say they can have it , i want nothing of it . belle de jour runs 1 : 40 which , with its loose editing by louisette hautecoeur , keep making me want to shout "" okay , lets get this scene moving .

"the big hit is as irreverent as parodies come , and exhibits a great deal more energy than the tired , pun-filled naked gun clones . this movie isn't afraid of venturing into the realm of bad taste -- in fact , it revels in it . there's sure to be something in the big hit to offend just about everyone , but the film is audacious enough that i found myself gaining sporadic entertainment from its cheerful , cartoonish spoofing . he's a hit man who has killed about 100 people , but is afflicted with an undesirable weakness for someone in his position : "" i can't stand the idea of anybody not liking me . "" the plot is ludicrous and the acting falls neatly into one of two categories : way over-the-top or simply awful . mark wahlberg is badly miscast as melvin . his rather bland portrayal of the hitman fails to energize certain comic scenes that should have been funnier . christina applegate , lainie kazan , and elliot gould are all irritatingly bad , but i believe that's actually the point . i don't think the film makers had oscar nominations in mind when they cast these three . newcomer china chow is the only one who shows any promise , and that's not saying much . the big hit's comedy is widely variable -- some of it is funny and clever while some is weary and familiar . during the course of the movie's 90 minute running time , the big hit gives us ethnic caricatures , tremendously over-the-top car chases , and jokes involving vomit , mutilated body parts , masturbation , hara-kiri , video store clerks , high- tech call tracing methods , chicken stuffing , and king kong lives ( arguably one of the worst movies of all time ) . how often you laugh is likely dependent upon a few factors : your mood , your tolerance for humor in bad taste , and your willingness to ignore wahlberg's wooden performance and lack of chemistry with his female co-stars . wong directs the big hit with more flair than the material perhaps deserves . this is a colorful , kinetic motion picture that never threatens to bore even a viewer afflicted with attention deficit disorder . there are a lot of shoot-outs and other action sequences , and , while none of them are suspenseful or thrilling , they're suitably noisy . i viewed most of these as takeoffs on more generic testosterone- and-adrenaline sequences , and , seen on that level , they work . the less seriously one takes things , the better they work . as low-intelligence entertainment goes , this film is very much a hit-and-miss affair .

"for anyone who is familiar with the movies of the late john cassavetes , one of america's most fiercely independent film makers of the '60s and '70s , there will be no doubt that the screenplay for she's so lovely came from his pen . and , since rowlands appears in she's so lovely , this is , in a sense , a family production . nick is more of a polished , traditional film maker . what might she's so lovely have been like had john cassavetes directed it ? while it's impossible to know for sure , we need look no farther than cassavetes' most celebrated film , a woman under the influence , for some clues . so , while i'm not trying to suggest that the films are identical in any significant way , the similarities are striking enough to offer an idea of the kinds of themes that were important to john cassavetes . in 1996 , there was a film called mad love , starring chris o'donnell and drew barrymore . that title would have been very appropriate for she's so lovely , a darkly comic drama about the debilitating effects of drinking from a cocktail made of love and insanity . many of the film's themes are not fully realized , but , even in this form , it's difficult to deny the impact of she's so lovely , especially since it questions where our responsibility to ourselves ends and where our responsibility to our family begins . both eddie and maureen exhibit streaks of violent , self-destructive behavior . this creates an interesting dynamic -- since we , the audience , don't have a rooting interest , we are able to watch the characters' actions from a somewhat detached perspective . while there are times that the script shows seams , the powerhouse performances of penn and wright penn allow us to overlook many of these . in a way , she's so lovely functions more as an outline of a story than the actual story , but the two lead characters are presented so vividly , and their interaction is so intense , that it doesn't seem to matter much . if there's a weakness in character development , it's that joey is a pretty one-dimensional lout , and travolta plays him much like vincent vega from pulp fiction . she's so lovely is uncomfortable because it challenges our perceptions about love and family . maureen and joey have the american dream , but does it really mean anything ? some viewers will undoubtedly be dismayed by the film's abrupt ending ( which isn't really an ending at all ) , but , by the time the end credits roll , we know all that we need to know to guess how things will probably turn out . she's so lovely isn't a flawless production , but it's a fitting tribute to john cassavetes , and a reminder of the many ways that a woman can be under the influence .

"e . j . an unconscionable clinker for those who are more impressed with intellect in films than with special effects , for a film costing 200 million dollars to make , while doing a dutiful job in recreating the grandeur of the ship and its ritzy atmosphere , but failing in everything else , except in the gall to think it has created a masterpiece . if there is anyone out there who stills believes there is such a thing as an unsinkable ship , you'll believe leonardo dicaprio's innocuous portrayal of an artist on board the ill-fated ship and that the soap opera story told is tantamount to a work of art . films backed by big money like this one , rarely ever go after controversy , much preferring to steer a trouble-free course , with a clever eye to the bottom line . i think any actress on board that ship could have played that part . it is hard to believe how trite and contrived this story was , and how everyone in this film had no depth of character . everyone was a wooden stereotype of what their class status was supposed to be like . what gave this film watch ability , was the way the ship was recreated down to its last details , giving one the romantic feeling that one was on the real voyage . at least , the money spent for visual effects went to some good usage . what was ultimately unforeseen , was that the weather created conditions that made it impossible to detect icebergs , which the ship rammed into at full speed . the photography was great . the costumes were terrific . the sound system was as good as it gets . everything about the special effects was first-class . if you judge a film by those standards , then you will be more than pleased with this film . if you are looking for a cruise into deeper water , then i'm afraid you boarded the wrong film , this one will only leak all over you . i waited a long time to see this film , choosing to watch it on tv and not on a big screen theater ; i have no regrets why i waited so long . by the way , i saw a night to remember ( 1958 ) , and thought that version of the titanic to be just grand , not cluttered with a trivial story , just sticking to the suspense of the historical event , which was fine and dandy by my non technical cerebral standards .",DSc
"for the movie's 60th anniversary , disney has devised an almost all-new film ; only mickey's famous "" sorcerer's apprentice "" segment remains . fantasia , perhaps cinema's most beloved musical montage , has not merely been updated . it has an entirely new medium for its latest incarnation . disney decided that they would shoot it in imax , a format normally reserved for films in which the viewers vicariously risk their lives climbing mountains ( everest ) or riding roller coasters ( thrill ride ) . the resulting film , fantasia/2000 , is a real treat for the ears . it is in the visuals that the movie comes up so short that it has to be labeled a disappointment . given the three-dimensional realism that we've seen this past year from disney ( tarzan ) , pixar/disney ( toy story 2 ) and other studios ( the princess mononoke ) , most of the illustrations in fantasia/2000 look flat and uninviting by comparison . then there is the choice of imax as the medium , which might seem a cute idea but turns out to be a fundamental mistake . blown up several stories high , the animation's flaws are magnified . what should be compelling instead turns out to be too busy and garish as gigantic images flash across the screen . mickey's segment , especially , suffers by being stretched . why they didn't repaint the colors is a mystery because it leaves this episode looking needlessly dated due to its grainy texture . when it ends , they cut to a properly colored mickey , which just emphasizes the inadequate restoration of the original portion . fantasia/2000 isn't a bad movie , just one with so much potential that it causes you to dwell on its flaws . take the whale sequence . as these beautiful animals frolic and splash in the ocean , the director decided not to include any sound effects . normally such a scene would have had some realistic water sounds overlaid with the music . without them , the piece has a strangely remote and detached feeling . go in with low expectations , try not to be too demanding when it comes to the animation and fantasia/2000 will prove a pleasant enough experience . just try to forget how good it could and should have been . it is rated g and would be fine for all ages , although many kids will be bored as there is little plot to hold their attention . my son jeffrey , age 10 , liked the movie enough to give it  . it was so different for him that he didn't know quite what to make of it or how to rate it . he liked most of the segments , except the ending one , which he found too fast and confusing .",SRh
"in hollywood , the place where paradigms reign and conceptual blockbusting goes to die , among the most hallowed of paradigms is the 90 minute running time . you may be able to get away with 85 , and five or ten fewer for an animated feature , but anything less would appear to risk rending the very fabric of space-time . never mind that a popular 45-minute film , with its potential for nine or ten cut-rate showings a day plus concession sales from twice as many intermissions , would be an exhibitor's fantasy . the 90-minute mandate exists for one fairly obvious , and fairly depressing , reason : it's less complicated for studios to keep throwing money at bloated , mediocre films than it is for them to figure out how to make and market shorter , better ones . nothing to lose could have been a hilarious 30 or 40 minutes of comic film-making . instead , it's an over-stuffed 97 minutes , not because it should have been but because it _had_ to be . along the way , writer-director steve oedekerk places nick and t . paul into some bizarre and truly inventive situations . at odd moments , nothing to lose will catch you off guard with a memorable supporting performance or an unpredictable punch line . since oedekerk is a veteran of stand-up comedy and sketch writing for "" in living color , "" it should be surprising that hit-and-run gags play to his strengths . nor should it be surprising that the length of a feature film does not . he fills the spaces between clever comic moments with sub-plots which probably were meant to provide "" depth , "" but instead merely provide "" length .

"director : gary sinyor . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( profanity , adult themes ) running time : 100 minutes . i came to an epiphany while watching the bachelor , an innocuous-enough-on-the-surface romantic comedy . it's not the sort of film in which one would expect to achieve any moment of clarity , but there it was nonetheless . i sat there watching this marshmallow of a movie unfold when suddenly i realized what is so ridiculously wrong with the entire romantic comedy genre circa 1999 . in a word , it's the same thing that's wrong with so many movies circa 1999 : writing . more to the point , it's the refusal to acknowledge that characterizations matter when you're telling a story about a relationship . the bachelor is merely the latest in a long line of films where we're expected to get dewy-eyed over any pairing of attractive , pleasant people just because they're attractive and pleasant . convinced despite his reservations that it's time to "" sh * t or get off the pot , "" jimmy proposes to anne -- very badly . it's a wacky , brewster's millions-esque premise ( acknowledged as such in one of the film's better , more self-aware lines of dialogue ) , the kind where a shallow and materialistic guy learns what really matters . at least that would be the case if jimmy weren't already a world-class altruist . it's almost embarrassing for his marital misgivings to play a role in the bachelor's plot development . by any human standard , the guy is impossibly selfless . and that's the essence of the gutlessness endemic to films like the bachelor -- the fear of giving the characters flaws to overcome on their way to happiness . there's never any tension between the two star-crossed lovers , because there's no sense that anything remotely significant is at stake . and forget about seeing enough of jimmy and anne together to feel invested in their potential reconciliation . the parade of sit-com set pieces had better be damned funny , since they're all that stands between us and a blissfully sweet foregone conclusion . i'll admit a couple of those set pieces are amusing , including ustinov's rantings about procreation and a restaurant full-to-bursting with men popping questions and champagne corks . far more of them are either tedious or downright ghastly , like the shudder-inducing sight of brooke shields as an icy fortune-hunter or the hideous collection of stereotypes when hundreds of potential brides gather in a church . you're never going to get too many raucous belly laughs from a film like the bachelor , but that's not the real problem . nor is it the real problem that you know exactly the kind of warm-n-fuzzy conclusion it's leading up to . the problem are a beginning and middle that are equally warm-n-fuzzy -- there's no spark , no energy , no humanity . it's an emotional pudding guaranteed not to offend any consumer's digestions . we've reached a point where our proxies for cinematic romantic wish fulfillment don't even have a pulse . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .",SRe
"there is a scene in face/off when all hell breaks loose and both sides are shooting so fast that it looks like rival fireworks vendors in a turf war . in the midst of this gotterdammerung , john travolta and nicolas cage face each other in their big showdown like a shoot out at the ok corral . only hong kong action director extraordinaire john woo would choose to set this pyrotechnic ballet to a version of judy garland's "" somewhere over the rainbow .

"disney made a cartoon version of the story in 1967 , and famous director zoltan korda made a live action film of it during the war ( 1942 ) . in this 1984 disney version , stephen sommers is the director and the screenwriter . he says of it the jungle , "" the jungle speaks to me because i know how to listen .

"the action takes place offscreen . some viwers might consider niagara more of a steamy melodrama than a noir , but it does have all the dark ingredients fitting a noir film , whereby an innocent is overtaken by a lust that consumes him , while the femme fatale is a heartless schemer with a large sexual appetite . this was marilyn monroe's first starring role , after having been in already eighteen other films , but mostly in small roles . director hathaway does a nice job of crafting the film and exploiting its colorful location , but what he doesn't do that well , is allow the mystery part of the story to gracefully unfold . the last reel plays like an action film , with a strangulation , a kidnapping , a helicopter rescue , and one character doomed to be going over the falls . in contrast to the loomis' , the cutler's are seen as being a conventional couple , and the camera seems to be gently eyeballing them and showing that their sex life is calmer and more suited for a positive and loving relationship than the loomis' . yet the normal couple is attracted to the more exotic one , especially polly , through whose eyes the film is filtered out to us .",DSc
"our collective existential/millennial/y2k-bug angst now has been channelled officially into one cinematic premise : the line between reality and virtual reality is growing too thin for comfort , and cyberspace is intruding on our personal space . though the marketing campaign ( and official web site ) teases us with the cryptic question "" what is the matrix ? "" , it wouldn't be giving anything away to say that it's something you'll be seeing a lot of over the next few months . we'll all be fortunate if what we see is as kinetically entertaining as the matrix . if that description seems a bit coy , it's only because part of the fun in the first half of the matrix is allowing its bizarre cosmology to unfold . though there's plenty of exposition required to explain what's going on in the matrix , the wachowskis manage to do it with a wink and a smile , investing the expository segments with wit and imagination . the film's first hour is somewhat slow going , yet even while waiting for it to gain momentum there's a certain confidence that it will . and boy , does it ever . the action sequences in the matrix are some of the best in a long time , combining wicked visual effects ( familiar to those who've seen any gap commercials lately ) with creative choreography . fully aware that they're dealing physics of their own invention , the wachowskis let loose with both barrels , sending the matrix over-the-top and into the realm of video game excess . amazingly , it almost never feels like a video-game movie , thanks mostly to the wachowskis' sure-handed pacing but also to some ingenious casting . the matrix is a blast , but it's never a dumb blast . there are plenty of places where it feels like the matrix could have been tidied up a bit -- a lengthy chase here , a pointless romantic angle there , a conversation about why everything tastes like chicken over there -- to bring the running time down below two hours . it's the kind of movie that will turn off plenty of viewers , either because of its violence , its convoluted story or its pokiness in getting to the good stuff . others will see the matrix as the kind of film that makes use of action and special effects instead of being used by them , the kind of film that takes that extra moment to turn its big showdown into a classic spaghetti western confrontation . if virtual reality is the flavor of the month , plug me in to something like the matrix , and give me a world where the adventure is worth two hours of my time . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .",SRe
"although i have not been a jarmusch fan before this picture , i am now . dead man features a great performance by the ever enthralling johnny depp ( ed wood , don juan demarco and edward scissorhands ) , impressive and moving black and white cinematography by robby mueller ( to live and die in la and repo man ) , and a score by neil young so strong that it dominates , but never overpowers the picture . although the show is quirky enough not to be everyone's cup of tea , i was blown away by it . the fireman prophetically advises him , "" i wouldn't trust no words written on no piece of paper .

"" meanwhile , anyone who comes to batman and robin expecting great action sequences will be disappointed . the fight scenes aren't interesting -- they're poorly choreographed , badly edited , and interrupted by too many one-liners . the "" hockey team from hell "" sequence is a perfect example : it seems to go on forever , but we're never really sure exactly what's happening ( or why it's happening , for that matter ) . batman and robin moves at a dizzying pace , yet goes absolutely nowhere . somewhere between the quarter and mid-point of this film , things turn repetitious and tedious . we see basically the same fight scene re-enacted three or four times -- and it isn't all that impressive on the first occasion . we become numb to the glitz and glamour , but , looking beyond it , we see only a vacuum . in trying to put the "" comic "" back into "" comic book "" , schumacher has reduced batman to the equivalent of a daily newspaper strip -- disjointed and painfully shallow . the character probably deserves more respect , but , in batman and robin , he doesn't get it . and , for that matter , neither does the audience .",JBe
"presumably , after making thirteen movies with woody allen , mia farrow has been missing the wry human insight and cleverly-concocted scripts which characterize allen's work . for obvious reasons , however , a farrow/allen corroboration isn't anywhere on the horizon . so what's the actress to do ? perhaps try something a little different , somewhat similar , and obviously inferior . how about miami rhapsody , or , by another name , woody allen lite ? what writer/director david frankel has managed with miami rhapsody is to capture some of the feel of an allen movie without nearly the same degree of intelligence or character realization . this film stands up reasonably well against most contenders , provided you don't consider the really good ones . miami rhapsody is an anthology picture featuring no less than nine significant characters . of necessity , lots of corners get cut and , predictably , storylines are stripped to the bare bones . as portrayed by sarah jessica parker , she's great with the barbed one-liners ( "" all the good moments are happening to someone else "" , "" you have the subtlety of a woodpecker "" , "" it's always natural for the female to be in agony "" ) but weak on emotions . as her potential fiance observes , all she wants to do is talk , and this diffuses any straight dramatic focus . not to mention boring . to frankel's credit , he doesn't stay true to the easy romantic comedy model . this is largely due to the allen influence , but it gives miami rhapsody a certain element of freshness . quite a few of the jokes are funny ; the characters are generally affable , if not tremendously well fleshed out ; and the story flows smoothly . often , miami rhapsody attains the flavor of an intelligently-written tv sitcom . miami rhapsody probably aspires to something more grand than it succeeds at . the movie gives us glimpses of a variety of successful and failing relationships , but spends too much time on quips and too little on exploring lives . in proceeding in this manner , miami rhapsody proves that even with mia farrow , frankel still has a long way to go to equal allen .",JBe

"most cross-dressing comedies are played for broad laughs . tootsie is an example , as is the recent mrs . doubtfire . in both cases , transvestism as a plot device is a means to an end--and that end is humor . the sight of dustin hoffman or robin williams in drag is intended to bring on fits of mirth . just like a woman , however , has a different perspective , and while there are chuckles aplenty , they're likely not for the same reasons . the movie starts out much like a "" traditional "" romantic comedy . just like a woman takes great pains to treat the subject of transvestism with a modicum of sensitivity , while avoiding taking a preachy stance . the gerald/geraldine transformations are not presented farcically , but with a care to show how important this part of his life is to the main character . ultimately , monica doesn't have a problem with this--in fact , once she gets used to it , she starts to enjoy it . the comedy is uneven . some of the most clever bits are the less- obvious ones , such as the use of the song "" devil in disguise "" during one scene , or a double entendre about "" dressing "" on a salad . on the other hand , there are two sequences--one involving a hypnotist and another occurring during a board meeting--where things get too silly , crossing the line from funny to ridiculous . mostly , when just like a woman concentrates on the gerald/monica relationship , it's on safe ground . however , there's another half to the story . this subplot , which involves backstabbing and in-fighting at gerald's place of work , takes up a lot of unnecessary time . it isn't particularly engaging , and its ultimate purpose is to afford the opportunity for a disappointing , "" crowd-pleasing "" ending . adrian pasdar does a credible job , playing gerald/geraldine with dignity instead of going over-the-top . in frocks and makeup , he passes quite effectively as a female ( and is decidedly less homely than dorothy in tootsie ) . just like a woman isn't really about tolerance , although that comes into it . this was intended as a romantic comedy with a slightly different spin , and in that aim , it is successful . unfortunately , the secondary storyline can't be brushed aside easily , given its importance to the finale . the result is a moderate diminution of the movie's more enjoyable aspects .",JBe
"it's probably just a coincidence , but the two bond films that maud adams appeared in -- the man with the golden gun and octopussy -- are easily the silliest entries in the long-running series ( not counting the intentional spoof casino royale ) . in a duel of dumb storylines , octopussy loses , but only by a length . there's a fine line between wit and absurdity , and this particular movie too often falls on the wrong side . even though connery's return was a remake of thunderball and didn't have the john barry/monty norman theme music , it was still better than octopussy . moore , on the other hand , had been at it for a decade , and was just going through the motions . fatuousness replaced flair . bond , never the most rounded character at the best of times , had become a caricature of himself . the plot for octopussy is so circuitous and convoluted that it doesn't make much sense . bond movies are at their best when they have a straightforward storyline -- viewers don't want to piece together different aspects of the film . however , even deep thought won't resolve all of octopussy's tangled plot knots . while jourdan is deliciously cool , berkoff gives the worst performance , bar none , of any bond bad guy . while a certain element of over-the-top acting is expected from everyone in a 007 adventure , berkoff does an offensively bad job that renders every scene he's in almost unwatchable . despite having the title role , maud adams doesn't have much more to do than in the man with the golden gun . this isn't a film where 007 is especially concerned with the women , except to slip into and out of their beds . the most foolish elements of the film include a bizarre chase through the streets of new delhi , bond doing a tarzan imitation , and an attack by circus performers on the villain's hideout . 007 has a variety of disguises here , including a mechanical crocodile , a gorilla suit , and a clown costume . octopussy has its funny moments , but there are a few too many times when we're laughing at the movie rather than with it . later in the film , there's a pulse-pounding chase-and-battle sequence that takes place on the roof of a moving train . considering his lackluster performance here , which is at least partially responsible for this film's absence of flair and energy , the decision seemed appropriate .",JBe
"( this makes impersonating him unusually easy -- one fake breast , and voila ) . the gun itself is a beautiful piece of weaponry that can be assembled on the spot from its slick , smoothly rounded pieces . moore , clearly comfortable with his part this time , executes with precision albeit not with connery's flair and charisma . still , moore is believable this time as bond , something george lazenby never was . the film , especially in its nighttime sequences , handsomely photographed by ted moore and oswald morris , continues the bond tradition of taking us to beautiful and exotic foreign locals . ah , the bond women . the bond films progressively push the limits of almost displaying nudity without ever showing it clearly . but the bond films prize their family-friendly ratings so technically we don't exactly see her . as bond says to scaramanga , "" we all get our jollies one way or another . "" bond films titillate , but only within carefully controlled bounds . britt ekland plays mary goodnight , bond's lovely , brave , but sometimes not too bright fellow agent . in the case of ekland , there are other reasons why a bikini uniform is a particularly desirable clothing choice . i could do without bond's image as he smokes foot long cigars . and maybe there are those who still think so today an ugly american , he spews racial epithets at the local chinese that will have you wanting to cover your ears in shame . the nicest thing he is says is that they could get to work faster if they'd get out of those silly pajamas . one hopes that this character will not appear again . in contrast to the poorly choreographed fight sequences in many of the earlier bond films , this one has a perfectly executed and quite funny one set at the villain's martial arts school . the film's obligatory car chase cum demolition derby is a carbon copy of a hundred other pictures . only the great bond theme music makes it anything special . the previous film , live and let die , for example , had the same chase , better executed . two of the story's shoot-outs occur in a funhouse-style shooting gallery that looks like they were lifted straight out of an episode of the television series , "" the avengers . "" but given that they borrowed the idea , it's good to see that they stole from the best . this time it's the other side that has the best gadget -- a wing with a jet engine that can be attached to a car to turn it into an airplane . nothing less than a monopoly on solar energy , which we are told will upset the world's oil sheiks . most of the story however is a simple series of chase scenes . we learn almost nothing about the grand strategy until the last twenty minutes of the picture so that it feels almost tacked on . the result is an entertaining film but not a very substantial one . it is rated pg for sexual innuendo and violence and would be fine for kids around nine and up . my son jeffrey , almost 9 , said it was an okay movie and better than the previous one with roger moore .",SRh

"burnt by the sun is a russian film and was the winner of the 1995 academy award for best foreign film . the plot from there made little sense so i will not attempt to outline the story more . if you like russian style humor or if you monty python style british humor , you will probably go gaga over this show . i was at a fairly full movie house where most of the audience set in stone silence as if they didn't get it . a few people however were in non-stop laughter mode . for this show you either love or you hate it . there is no in-between . as you can guess by the rating , i am in the i-don't-get-it category . let me note the two highlights of the show . first , the cinematographer ( vilen kaluta ) manages to make an oppressive dictatorship have a radiant feel that makes you think old joe stalin's country would have been a pretty peaceful place to live . picture perfect . notice how the camera hugs them in the close ups and how the shots are carefully done with a twilight glow . the second highlight of the movie was in the attractive and visually interesting actors cast to play the lead father , mother , and young girl . i found the script by roustam ibraguimbekov and nikita mikhalkov to be a mess . certainly there were the odd , good one liners . mainly though the scriptwriters and the director ( nikita mikhalkov ) relied on broad humor and sight gags of the monty python style . we also had many fat people who were supposed to be funny solely because of their girth . in one scene , a fat woman blocks mitya's view and that in and of itself is supposedly humorous . we have a summer santa figure in a long ugly beard , long hair , and bad clothes , that was supposed to make us laugh . many of the characters had exaggerated gestures in failed attempts at humor . i generally don't like slapstick comedy , and this movie was no exception . i have now seen all of the 1995 academy award for best foreign films . i enjoyed burnt by the sun least of all . although i liked parts of all of the others , eat drink man woman was the only consistently excellent one of the bunch . see my reviews of all of them for more details . it is in russian with english subtitles . it is unrated , but would be pg or perhaps pg-13 for very brief nudity and a little violence . it is a harmless show . i do not recommend it unless you are into sight gags , exaggerated characters , or a fan of russian humor . for the beauty of the filming and for no other reason , i award it  .",SRh
"when it comes to embracing camp , there's no halfway point . to be successful in this arena , a movie must turn its back on even the semblance of conventionality , expressing everything from the most insignificant line of dialogue to a climactic event with an irreverence that would make the monty python troupe members offer winks and nudges of appreciation . it is because tank girl takes this approach that it germinates into a high-spirited , madcap example of film making run amok . certainly , this movie isn't art , but it sure is fun . film adaptations of comic books have become nearly as prevalent as those based on stephen king stories . nothing is sacred--this movie pushes the envelope as far as it will go , and the result is an offbeat and energized juxtaposition of action and comedy . this is the kind of tone that films like hudson hawk , the last action hero , and demolition man tried in vain to capture . it's the mixture of seeming spontaneity and a total lack of seriousness that fuels whatever success tank girl has . the name of the game is outrageousness , and the script never attempts anything that might damage it . there is no characterization to speak of , and the plot is simply a nonsensical piece of fluff upon which to drape so much excess . and just when you think things can't get sillier , something happens to change your mind , whether it's the insertion of oddly-rendered animated sequences , a bizarre rendition of cole porter's "" let's do it "" , or lori petty's title character sporting a brassiere that would make madonna gasp with envy . in this scenario , the earth-devastating disaster was a comet strike , and it has left most of the globe in ruins and water in short supply . she gets all the right inflections on the one-liners and doesn't know the meaning of the term "" reserve "" . malcolm mcdowell , the consummate over-the-top villain , displays a far more delectable nastiness here than in star trek generations . with a breakneck , don't-bother-to-stop-and-think-about-it pace , tank girl zips along for over one-hundred moments , only occasionally lapsing from its zaniness . the rock-and-rap soundtrack , supervised by courtney love-cobain , invigorates certain scenes , and blends nicely with the visuals . judging by the finished product , it's pretty clear that director rachel talalay achieved her vision . tank girl is one of those chew-the-popcorn , munch-the-candy flicks--the kind you go into expecting to have a good time , but nothing more . given those expectations , disappointment is as unlikely as boredom .",JBe

"the godfather part iii is a good movie , with moments of rare power , but it is not a great one--a reason why many fans of the series have voiced their disappointment . oscar nominations for this film were probably based more on the godfather name and reputation than on the particular merits of this production . part iii became the first godfather not to take best picture and , despite a deserving performance , al pacino's efforts were not acknowledged . the lack of awards enthusiasm perhaps reflected a general opinion . the passing of the baton , however , carries with it a tragic price . one of the most obvious problems with the godfather part iii is that it covers little new territory . the plot is highly derivative of the original . this time , michael fills vito's role , and vincent stands in for michael . this method of too-obvious parallelism might have been more effective had vincent's character been better developed . that isn't the case , however , because michael is still the focal point . as always , pacino is a delight to watch . more than all the money and power on earth , [they] are my treasure . "" it is a prophetic statement . robert duvall is missed . it's impossible not to feel the vacuum created by his absence . george hamilton's b . j . barrison is a one- dimensional necessity of plot , not a "" real "" character . at least the decision was made not to replicate tom hagen in barrison . hamilton is given little more to do than stand in the background and speak a few lines . coppola is pleasant enough to look at , but her range is limited , and that lack of ability diminishes several emotionally-charged scenes . this is the first godfather to have a major role defined by a poor performance . one thing that is not inferior , however , is francis ford coppola's directorial flair . the final half-hour , with its interweaving of diverse-yet-related plot lines , is choreographed with the skill of a master . there are moments of the godfather part iii that shine with the brilliance of the previous two films . despite its missteps , the godfather part iii packs enough of a punch to deserve a place alongside its predecessors . this is no poorly- conceived curiosity . not only does the film bring michael corleone's story to a conclusion , but it remains faithful to the form and style of parts i and ii . taken as one grand epic , with this chapter included , the godfather movies represent one of the most solid , emotionally-rich tales ever committed to film .",JBe
"little angel , the latest offering from german film maker helke misselwitz , is a poignant , powerful character study , as well as a look at the potentially debilitating effects of loneliness . distinguished by strong acting and an even stronger script , little angel slowly-but- surely pulls the viewer into its grim , grimy , everyday world and keeps us there as this tragic tale follows its inevitable trajectory . for the audience , this is a voyeuristic , fly-on-the-wall experience . it's a powerful way to build a character , and it works to perfection . as the movie progresses , we experience ramona's ups and downs with her . this isn't the kind of film that engages its viewers on a purely intellectual plane . a fleet of supporting characters populate little angel , but the focus never wavers from ramona and andrzej . susanne lothar's performance is especially noteworthy -- she becomes ramona in every way that is important , giving herself to the role . the complexity and depth of her character is due in equal part to misselwitz's perceptive script and lothar's memorable interpretation of it . we have all experienced loneliness at one time or another -- it's one aspect of the human experience that anyone can relate to , and that makes ramona's plight all-the-more immediate . little angel offers a slice of many aspects of life : beauty and ugliness , joy and tragedy , passion and pain . ramona's story touches the heart without ever resorting to manipulation , and that's the singlemost outstanding characteristic of little angel . the movie , currently playing the international festival circuit , is worth seeking out .",JBe

""" sleepy hollow "" is like many other tim burton and danny elfman collaborations : a visual treat and a stylistic thriller . it may not contain tremendous substance but it is sure a pleasure to look at . i took a brief look at an e-text of the original "" the legend of sleepy hollow "" by washington irving ( as any remaining memory i had of the legend itself came from the disney movie and only featured the headless horseman riding about ) , and i must say i liked what the writers were able to sculpt out of the original story . they had to , because the original might have been a fun read but was no movie material . instead , it is to their credit that we get interesting and * convincing * characters from colonial times who seem to have leapt right out of the real story from irving , when in fact most of them were newly created . now i am not so worried for those who might have their plot spoiled for them because they have read the book . much better than that "" psycho "" remake fiasco , eh ? the town of sleepy hollow is but one out of many of the film's visual triumphs . perpetually shrouded in fog and gloom , the town seems steeped in misery even in daytime . even the haystacks look morose . the film begins with awkward shots and a slackening pace but eventually picks up its rythmn . this gets repetitive and pretty much every time the sun sets we know what is going to happen . we also saw too many heads actually getting chopped off . if we hadn't gotten used it so quickly , perhaps it would have a greater effect on us . that , however , doesn't distract from the horror when it * does * happen . the film is a triumph of black and white and shades of grey ( only to be disrupted by the end by that horrible sunlight ) and mesmerizing visual images and effects . particularly enchanting are ichabod's memory scenes which are beautiful yet horrifying to look at . johnny depp plays a wonderfully amusing ichabod crane ; and while christina ricci was decent in her role , i still maintain that she was miscast because she looks too much like a child . the rest of the characters were just as superbly cast . not only was the film a wonderfully macabre piece , it was a glimpse into states of affairs when an earlier turn of century was about to arrive . it was a treat surveying the costumes , the settings , their "" autopsy bay "" and ichabod's peculiar tools . things that most of us in modern america have forgotten ever existed before . picture an edward gorey cartoon . ever seen one of those ? there's no story to it . it's just death , and even though it is a simple cartoon , it conjures up a sense of dread in you . that is comparable to watching "" sleepy hollow .

"there was no visible difference between the characterization of a sleek photography magazine , frame , that is the subject of the film , and the film itself , with all its glib characters provoking an air of chic fashion , all in the pretense of art . it is a performance that makes the film seem greater than how it really is . the complications that arise out of this new relationship is the springboard for the plot . the two of them seem to have a chemistry together and their kissing scenes did give us a needed look into their passions , with the more controlling lucy being in charge of things and instigating the relationship to be more sexual . she has most of the lines in the film that pack a wallop . the combo of the three women with different intentions and personalities , plays well , as the acting here is really fine . all the actors were properly ensconced in their roles and supported each other very well . eventually the film , after being carried along by sheedy's intense performance , dies an ungraceful death from too much of its slickness ; it ran out of things to resolve other than by means of contrivance , and it was highly questionable that the "" art "" seen was really worthy of being deemed as something special . we just lost interest in the characters , the film began to look like a commercial for a magazine that wouldn't stop and get to the main article . so what could have been cutting edge dramatics , if the lesbian romance was followed through further , turns out to be a film not about art , but more of a soap opera story , about how three women , at different stages of their life , get together and separate . all the pain that is there , is finally settled in the usual way sitcoms settle problems they don't want to handle any more . which left the film only somewhat satisfying ; it did create a proper atmosphere for us to view these lost characters , and it did have something to say about how their lives are being emotionally torn apart . but we only get a voyeurs look at them , and that is not enough of a look for us to say that we penetrated into their world of mind-games and drug induced delusions and need for each other . the film just looked too much like the slick magazine it presented in the film ; that it wanted to say something more about syd's sudden sexual reversal and about the despair in lucy's life , but it just couldn't get it out what it wanted to say , which is why the film became a let down . its style was , perhaps , too beautiful for its own good . it would have been wiser to develop more depth for the main characters and show them to be more than the superficial beings they seemed to be on screen . being a talented photographer is not necessarily being a fully developed person , as evidenced by lucy's dissolute lifestyle and poor decision making .",DSc
"starring : nicolas cage , shirley maclaine . screenplay : hugh wilson and peter torokvei . director : hugh wilson . i mean no condescension when i say that guarding tess is the kind of movie that my grandparents would love . they see about a movie per year , if that , and when they do choose to plunk down their $7 . 00 a piece they tend to opt for something light and frothy , usually one of those comedies featuring two decent but strong-willed characters who spar but obviously care about each other . these films are always good for a few smiles , and are generally inoffensive . intellectually , i understand the appeal of such once- in-a-blue-moon-night-on-the-town entertainments , and some of them do give the character interaction zing . it's just two pleasant , well-acted characters with nothing to do . guarding tess owes every ounce of charm it displays to the very engaging lead performances of nicolas cage and shirley maclaine . cage often seems to have only two gears on screen--frantic and manic--but here he des a surprisingly restrained turn as the frustrated agent . he is appropriately humorless about a job doug takes very seriously , yet he doesn't go for wooden . maclaine , who seems to get every role in hollywood written for a woman over 50 , has mastered the flinty dame bit by now , while always managing to leave a bit of softness around the edges . tess is not a particular stretch for maclaine , but she never mails in a performance . the interaction between doug and tess in the film's first half hour is amusing in a low-key way , never degenerating into over-the-top theatrics . at almost every stage the relationship seems completely natural , and that relationship makes for some entertaining scenes . what torpedoes guarding tess is the sense that director and co-writer hugh wilson didn't really know what to do with these two characters . since wilson's greatest success has come on the small screen , it should come as no surprise that guarding tess feels a lot like a pilot for a series . the characters are established , but the plot is nearly non-existent . very quickly , guarding tess begins to repeat itself , with too many redundant scenes of doug and tess butting heads , tess winning and doug fuming . it's a film that just floats around like a hovercraft on a layer of niceness . then , when wilson finally seems to realize the need for a second plot point , he creates an utterly ridiculous subplot involving a kidnapping . i have this feeling the conclusion we see was not his first choice . there is a silly red herring involving tess's son which i suspect was not a red herring in some earlier incarnation , because the revelation of who the kidnappers are inspires a big "" what ? "" i also believe wilson might have considered a slightly darker resolution , but was concerned about ruining all the good will he had worked so hard to generate . the result is just grossly out of touch with the rest of the movie anyway . fluffy and inconsequential doesn't have to mean tedious . guarding tess might make a fine bargain matinee for someone seeking a chuckle or two . at least that's what i'd tell my grandparents .",SRe
"the film has no point to make but to emphasize that silly challenge , but , it at least softens its obnoxious attitude with an ending that is more satisfactory than what i expected from this shallow film . i can't see anyone but teenagers and , perhaps , hapless parents of teenagers , finding anything here of interest . though some adults might look back to those halcyon school days with an anxious leer and wish to recapture some pubescent memories of some shameful incident and to feel the nostalgia again through this movie . looking through the eyes of a lost adolescence is perhaps the only way to view this movie , a movie that makes sex into something that is implicitly evil . nevertheless , as awful as this gross-out film is , it will become a movie and video hit with its targeted youthful audience , following the footsteps of that other cheap thrill movie , "" there's something about mary , "" and because sex sells , other films like this one will unfortunately follow . the sexual awkwardness of the boys is exaggerated for comedic purposes , and the school looks as if it is around only as a stage for the teenager's rite-of-passage . everything in the film is used to get a laugh , but the film wasn't really funny , though its commercial success is due to the guilty laughs it evokes . for me , it was just a childishly gross and a sexually raunchy movie . but it smartly restrained itself and never pushed the envelope that step too far , staying well within the framework of how traditional sitcom comedy works . there were other gross-out scenes in a movie that had no edge , just embarrassing moments and vulgar gestures . if it weren't for all the grossness about sex and toilets , this would be a typical family-fare tv sitcom . the film sells itself through its sex scenes and then after exploiting every awkward sexual moment it possibly can from the teens , it reverses itself with a contrived moral ending to say that love is not forced and comes naturally , while those only interested in sex are creating unnecessary problems for themselves and putting undue pressure on themselves to be happy . his big deal , is that he can't say the four-lettered word love -- like , i love you vicky . the side players add to the gross-out gags . he is a particularly rich and obnoxious jock . a totally unnecessary scene , that was played without emotion or reason . the film's saving grace is the sound advice given about romance by the females . everything else about the film was just as gross as it appeared to be . the unimaginative comedy is of the lowest level , meant to titillate those in need of a teenage sexual massage .",DSc

"sometimes even the slightest of comedies can come alive with the right talent . so it is with the matchmaker , an irish comedy staring janeane garofalo . and not since the truth about cats & dogs has she been given a part where she looks so appealing . in the latter film she wasn't supposed to be cute , but was and even outshone uma thurman . soon , however , the weather in this charming tale turns to bright , glorious sunshine . as dermot , the local matchmaker , milo o'shea gives a heartwarming performance . the story keeps cutting to a home video he is making extolling the virtues of matchmaking . as we learn in a ross perot-style pie chart presentation , the four ingredients of a good marriage are : love , sex , eating , and having a good laugh , with the latter having the largest slice . dermot's dead seriousness would work well on a late night infomercial . nothing like a third-degree burn to turn on the ladies .

"i don't usually do reviews of older movies , but patton happened to be playing in a local "" revival "" theater and , although i've seen the film many times on tv and video , i'd never before viewed it on a large screen . as a result , i took this opportunity to see it and subsequently write a review . by the way , for years now , i have considered patton to be my favorite all-time motion picture . what that says about my character , you can guess for yourself . . . . "" through the travail of ages midst the pomp and toils of war , have i fought and strove and perished countless times upon a star . as if through a glass , and darkly , the age-old strife i see , for i fought in many guises , many names , but always me . "" capturing eight oscars--including best picture , best director , best actor , best screenplay , best editing , and best production design--the movie won every major battle of the evening . such acclaim was richly deserved , for patton remains to this day one of hollywood's most compelling biographical war pictures . with its larger-than-life , yet at the same time singularly human , portrayal of gen . george s . patton , jr . , franklin schaffner's picture is an example of filmmaking at its finest . from production design and battle choreography to simple one-on-one dramatic acting , patton has it all . there is no scene in all one-hundred seventy minutes that doesn't work on some level . the news media of the time vilified him for this , and the history books have been little more kind . that single act , more than anything , typified the national perception of him . that side of the man is shown in patton , but there are more facets to the general's personality than what he presented in public . in its evenhanded presentation , patton does justice to those aspects of the general's character , in addition to the more obvious ones . into the role stepped george c . scott , giving the performance of a long and impressive career . indeed , scott became so identified with the character , and played the general so perfectly , that the patton of documentaries has since occasionally been referred to as "" an imposter . "" in a part that requires a skillful scaling of the emotional ladder , scott finds the perfect balance between bombast and subtlety . it is no exaggeration to say that , in the decade of the seventies , only men like brando , pacino , nicholson and de niro equalled what scott accomplished in patton . with the exception of patton , the only character given more than cursory attention is omar bradley , who is shown to be a conservative , level-headed antithesis to patton's impulsive , ill-tempered bluster . bradley begins the film serving under patton , and ends it as his superior . as bradley says , "" i do this job because i've been trained to do it . you do it because you love it .

"inspired by the maverick finnish director aki kaurismaki's 1987 "" hamlet goes business , "" michael almereyda ( another girl , another planet/nadja ) directs this updated mainstream , mock serious version of hamlet with great wit , style , and immediacy . he effortlessly transfers locations from denmark to the new york city of 2000 , which shows how malleable hamlet is and how right it seems to take it away from its staginess and sole reliance on dialogue instead of making it a more cinematic experience . but what almereyda fails to do in this slenderized ( no gravediggers here ) version of hamlet , is make his modern visuals jive with the staginess of the bard's words , therefore the film always felt jarring . even in some very beautifully mannered scenes , there was a note of clumsiness , indicating something was missing or didn't match about this far-reaching production that bordered on mawkish giddiness , though not quite falling down that hole . the old style english dialogue and the new visuals did not make for a coherent film , with the visuals being spectacular and relevant , while the dialogue seemed to be from another planet , or from another venue . i thought i would never say that shakespeare's hamlet is better visually than its dialogue , but in this film version , that is clearly the case . by not changing the tone of the shakespearian dialogue to the neurotically nasal everyday speech of the modern new yorker , while radically altering the visual effects to fit in with the current times , the film developed a split-personality , which it was never able to recover from . if you are going to change things , why make half the film conform to traditional shakespeare , when you could have taken a further risk and made the entire film a glittering display of inventiveness , and perhaps achieve a major breakthrough in how to present hamlet to a modern audience ! hamlet is a troubled soul who is a struggling digital videomaker , with fits of self-importance and bouts of illusionary grandeur . hamlet has such a grungy attitude . the video is a comically haphazard avant-garde work by the animator lewis klahr , showing a variety of historical film footage . hamlet and ophelia are a perfectly beautiful looking but obnoxious couple , who are plagued by the modern problem of lack of communication . it is difficult to take this hamlet in quite the same serious way it is usually presented onstage , and that's just fine . refreshingly , this film does not have one ounce of pretention to high culture . the cast all come with their own individual ideas about the characters they are playing and offer their odd renditions for the traditional roles . hawke delivers his "" to be or not to be "" soliloquy in the action video section of a blockbuster store . the story , though almost cut in half , still is basically the same . but the dramatic effect is different . you have to lose something when you throw away all that shakespeare dialogue . in some scenes we look through all the egotism of the characters through glass that is crystal clear and easy to shatter , and the effect is a sharpened sense of what we are seeing . but when the final tragedy unfolds , there is no real emotion in it , the film failed to pull us into that scene . it seemed as if the soul had been taken out of it . and that is the major fault of the film . what lingers , is a strong sense that we are steeped in a hamlet who must be viewed with urgency , a sense of foreboding gloom , and with a sense of ticklish glibness . the picture was shot in super 16 millimeter . its nyc face is given a glossy , bluish and grayish tint , catching all the limos , glass closets , and glass high-rise structures john de borman could film with his superlative camerawork . nyc never looked more like a glistening denmark or a glass house , while "" hamlet "" looks more like a work of visual poetry instead of sounding like great literature . an interesting concept , too bad almereyda couldn't completely pull it off . yet i applaud the chances he took and all the misses never completely deterred me from enjoying the film . it came awfully close to being camp , but the oddness of this unlikely cast playing shakespeare , somehow , held the film together and made it accessible to an audience that shakespeare might not have reached before . even though hawke's hamlet had the edge of a young man's immaturity and impetuousness , what would have really given this film a sense of manic self-consciousness , would have been to cast sean penn as hamlet , though james dean in that part would have been the ultimate coup de grace .",DSc

"they don't come gooier than this feel-good fluff piece without being too sugary for consumption . it's a romantic comedy that spins every formulaic device possible into overdrive to come up with its cutesy love story , missing only the presence of julia roberts and any sort of genuine passion . it plays as if it was an ad showing how the 'beautiful people' spend some quality time doing the nyc scene by taking in the waldorf astoria , bloomingdales , central park's wollman rink , and when looking up toward the skies they can even spot nyc's tallest skyscaper--the empire state building . it was all so superficial and predictable . the comedy was oooh so heavy-handed and the romance was unbearably contrived . to get in the mood for this goo , one has to find numerous coincidental situations believable even if they are not possible , which was asking too much from me . if you like a flick that's pretty to look at , has attractive leads , sells its love story like a $100 hooker sells herself at night in times square , is brainless and anti-septic , and requires no thought , then this film might be in your diet . after all she 'reasons , ' if that's a good word to use in this film review , they are both currently involved with someone else . house before a fireplace and a bunch of burning candles placed on stands at different heights in a setting that looks like it's an ad for furnishings placed in a bloomie's catalogue . can you guess if they will succeed ! the film gets comedy relief from the supporting cast . the one bit he does that saves this film for me , is write an hilarious obit for jon based on what the greeks might have said if they wrote obits for someone who died for love . he provides some laughs , except he hangs around too long in the story and begins to become tiresome . you can believe as this film does in "" fate determining one's future , "" but it does an awful job in proving its case . though , i've seen much worst romantic comedies . in this one , at least , the leads who didn't inspire me , didn't turn me completely off . which is the best i can say about this flick .",DSc
"over the past few years , there have been a number of "" behind the scenes "" movies about the film making world -- enough , in fact , that this category almost deserves to be considered as a genre in its own right . most of these films , like mistress , are forgettable . a select few , such as my life's in turnaround , have risen to the top , largely because of their ability to mix humor with pseudo-realistic events . this movie is keen , clever , and -- most important of all -- a nonstop exercise in hilarity . nightmares -- real , figurative , and cinematic -- will plague the production , and what eventually emerges will be nothing like what anyone envisioned . the cinematographer ( dermot mulroney , keener's real-life husband ) , an eye- patched character who looks like rambo but has the emotional sensitivity of alan alda , rarely lets a take go by without arguing the choice of shot . the mishaps of scene six provide ninety minutes of unbridled fun . often , the best comedies are blatantly stupid . in this case , however , we are presented with an intelligent and occasionally insightful screenplay . not only are several real-life incidents from dicillo's private stock of failures and frustrations represented , but the director isn't afraid to let fly with satirical barbs at just about any target , named or unnamed . amidst all the humor is an opportunity to learn a little about the difficulties of creating an independent feature -- a process far less glamorous that some might believe it to be . living in oblivion is wonderfully photographed , with the color-to-black- and-white transitions handled smoothly ( these aren't just an "" art device "" -- there's a legitimate reason for them ) , and several different film stocks in evidence . dicillo has crafted a near-masterpiece that may make more than a few best-ten lists at year's end . living in oblivion is packed with laughs and twists , and comes to an end far too soon . it's rare that a movie rolls the credits too early , but when this film fades to black , we're still longing for at least one more scene with reve , his cast , and crew . while it's true that we don't get much sense of these people off the set , they're so wonderful in and around the camera that it doesn't matter . best of all , living in oblivion doesn't demand that the viewer be a film buff -- just that he or she enjoys laughing .",JBe
"the last seduction is an excellent black comedy and thriller about lying , betrayal , sex , and murder . it is directed by john dahl and written by steve barancik . she is tougher than nails , never vulnerable , and would do absolutely anything to get what she wants . the movie bears some resemblance to the tough and double dealing of barbara stanwyck in double indemnity ( which i saw about a year ago on cable - check it out some time , it is excellent too ) . the script is sharp and witty . the staccato tone of the script reminds me of some of david mamet's writing especially in his movie house of games . all of this happens in the first few minutes . one of the messages he leaves on her answering machine is "" i love you and i am sure the feeling is mutual - you love you too "" . there are lots of plot twists - some predictable , some not , and one quite surprising . there are many great scenes . the pick up scene in the bar has never been done that way before and really worked well . in a typical hollywood movie , we would eventually find fiorentino's character's sweet side , but not here - she is a complete and perfectly evil character with no redeeming qualities . it is fascinating watching fiorentino to see what she will do next . she is quite an attractive actress . see if you like the ending . at first , i thought it too abrupt and then decided it was a good ending after all . i have no criticism of the show . if you like black comedy like say harold and maude or double indemnity , you will probably like this show . it is not a movie for everyone , but i certainly recommend it and award it  . the movie is not rated , but would be r for sex , some profanity , a little nudity , non-gory and non-bloody violence , and an adult theme . i would not take teenagers to see it ; it is an adult show . it runs a well edited 1 : 50 .",SRh
"a terrific cast does not necessarily make for a good pic . the film becomes ridiculous by the time of that unbelievable romance on the run and by its finale it becomes a hopeless mess . though , it's entertaining as it takes us into the modern commercial art world and pretentiously shows what it takes to be a modern artist , let's us eyeball jodie foster in the nude , and has dennis hopper do his usual eccentric character number--this time as a hit man who wants to be loved and play the sax like charlie parker . he will then give anne a choice : i finish you now , or i let you live and you belong to me . it ends with a bunch of silly action scenes involving a helicopter chase and an oil refinery explosion . since none of it made too much sense , the fun to be found in this largely improvised flick is to see if you can get some laughs from how absurd it is . since i only got a mild dosage of laughter out of it , i was only mildly pleased with the flick . originally made for european release under the title catchfire , backtrack wasn't given a general distribution until 1991 . but in 1991 it was given back some cut film footage and released on cable . i would have hated to see the film when it made less sense than it did now .",DSc
"in the words of actor douglas henshall , angels and insects , the latest film from music of chance writer/director philip haas , is "" merchant ivory meets tennessee williams . "" it's a fair comparison . the movie is a period piece , taking place in the late 1850s and early 1860s , but the air of victorian restraint is frequently disturbed by aggressive displays of sexuality . however , unlike the work of either merchant & ivory or tennessee williams , angels and insects is a presentation of ideas over characters . and , although competently acted , it lacks the one standout performance which could have transformed it from a fascinating motion picture to a great one . in many ways , this film is a study in contrasts : the passionate abandon of the south american natives to the structured restraint of england's victorian aristocrats , darwin's evolution to the bible's creation , butterflies to ants , and beauty to intelligence . haas has elected not to reveal the horror of eugenia's situation in one melodramatic moment of discovery . the entire narrative of angels and insects is fashioned like this , with slow , steady revelations . angels and insects compares human life to that of an ant colony . ants serve their queen selflessly rather than always seeking their own ends . humans think of themselves as civilized -- the product of generations of sexual selection -- but the true barbarism of their nature often surfaces . the drawback of angels and insects is a combination of lackluster characterization and mediocre acting . none of the men or women populating this film grab our sympathy . in the case of someone as shallow as eugenia , this is entirely appropriate , but william remains strangely distant , in part because of a bland performance by mark rylance . as anthony hopkins has shown , it's possible to present a passionate portrait of restraint . unfortunately , rylance's william is too often without soul or heart . this leads us to watch him with interest , but never become emotionally engaged in his travails . ultimately , the reason to see angels and insects is for its keen and intricate explorations of human sexual and social interaction . yet perhaps the most striking similarity is how members of both species are capable of stinging without remorse , unconcerned about the consequences . that's an uncomfortable message that everyone can relate to .",JBe
"a movie about divorce and custody in 1995 seems about as timely as a movie about mood rings . family breakups have been an all too familiar part of the american landscape for nearly thirty years , and countless dramas have told stories of acrimonious court battles in hand-wringing detail . still , i can't recall a comedy about the subject before bye bye love . and after it , i still can't . bye bye love is rarely funny , more often a weak and melodramatic retread of common tv-movie fare . only a few moments which have nothing to do with the film's main premise offer big laughs instead of cliched emotion . the three lead actors form a rather unlikely combo , and the quality of their performances is of widely varying quality . randy quaid is the best of the three , bitter without being irritating , gleefully spiteful without being frightening . he does get bye bye love's best sub-plot , a hilarious dinner date with a gloriously demented janeane garofolo , and he does a great slow burn . paul reiser really has only one character , his slightly befuddled , uptight nice guy "" mad about you "" persona , but he does it well . as a personality , he is appealing , but as a character , he becomes pretty boring here . matthew modine , is , quite simply , terrible . this isn't a performance good enough to be called mailed-in ; he even forgot to put a stamp on it . modine lacks any charm in an appallingly under-written role , looks bored most of the time , and gets stuck with a trite little speech about how it's all his father's fault he's such a cad . bye bye love basically comes off as a very confused movie , because it spends far too much of its time on the new relationships of its main characters instead of on the relationships between the fathers and their kids , making it just another "" dating in the 90s "" movie . when the movie does deal with the children at all , it is to have one of them scream out an accusation and/or cry , perhaps to be resolved later by a sensitive talk and a hug , perhaps not . it is a sad end to flanders' career , getting caught up in a truly annoying over-use of mcdonald's as a location , a plot device and , apparently , a major advertiser . even if bye bye love had decided to spend its time focusing exclusively on the parent-child relationships , it still would have been pretty difficult to pull off , because ultimately there is very little humor one can wring from family break-ups and their effects on children . any way you slice it , it is a bad situation for kids , and the makers of bye bye love mostly go for the heartstrings when dealing with the single parenting issue . it is left to the dads' romantic fumblings to probide what little humor there is , and it isn't enough . there have been comparisons between bye bye love and parenthood , but parenthood was both genuinely funny and genuinely touching . bye bye love is a genuine shame .",SRe
"the film does a marvelous job of giving us a feel about life in the early part of the 20th century and how resolute some genuine seekers of the truth were in carrying on the arguments of religious orthodoxy versus scientific reality . since he can't find anything phony about these photos , he is pressed into believing that maybe it is possible to prove that there is a spiritual world with such creatures in attendance . his tendency is to believe that faith is what we must live by : "" i don't need proof , faith is enough for me . "" one of the problems with the film , that took away some of its luster , was that charles acted in such a one dimensional manner , jumping from non-believer to a firm believer in fairies in such a rapid time , that it was hard to fathom what was going on in his head . therefore his story did not have the impact it could have had with a more drawn out response and introspective performance . he was not someone that we could warm up to in an instant without knowing more about him than his tragic loss . now kingsley's role is really structured to fit a rigid character who can't change , yet his presence on screen is dynamic , bringing much more to his villainous role than just that one dimension to it . we might not like him but we have a better understanding of him than we do of charles . wanted to like charles much more than we were given a chance to and we couldn't , mainly because we could never get close enough to him . but that is not to say his performance wasn't good . it was well-suited according to character , but it was not a stirring performance and not one that completely captured our imagination . what results is a film that is beautifully photographed and stimulating to the intellect and freshly innovative . and , for how many films can you say all that is true ? we are led to believe that religion doesn't work because it is too fearful to go inward ; that theosophy doesn't work because it is not a real experience for those partaking in their seances and pseudo-scientific experiments ; and , that science doesn't work because its knowledge is limited . but the love story remains secondary to the ideas presented about the afterworld ; her romantic interest in him just never becomes vital to the story . where the story is strongest and most convincing , is when it tries to debunk both the belief and disbelief in fairies . there is no rational argument he can present to edify what he knows for certain . this is a very intelligent and effective film , that raises many interesting ideas and questions about the supernatural . it is a serious film , that should be seen by an audience that is not afraid of a story with an unhappy ending ; it offers a fresh outlook to a meaningful experience about the afterworld . this topic has been virtually taboo in our culture ever since the '60s drug revolution imploded on the landscape and caused a generational war . but it is now the end of the century , and the questions alluding to a spiritual world and the use of psychedelics as one way to get there , are more relevant than ever . if there are quibbles with this imperfect film , they are not that significant when you consider how well it made its case about an afterworld . this is something western mystics might find easier to believe than others ; but , in any case , one seeking the truth still must choose which spiritual conditions to aspire to , and this film presents one such option . that this mysterious story was so captivating , showing how necessary it was for charles to find his place there and how believable his quest was , speaks highly of how well this film was crafted by the director .",DSc

"the price asked by mr . gaunt is always more than reasonable , at least where money is concerned , and if a couple of pranks have to be played to round out the deal , so be it . how is it that a film with a good cast , stylish direction and camera work , and an intriguing premise can turn out mediocre ? perhaps if the production crew had known the answer to this question , needful things would have been a far more engrossing and satisfying motion picture experience than it actually is . what at the outset is the film's strength turns into its greatest liability . unfortunately , once that has happened , the movie doesn't know where to go with the story , so it turns to the old hollywood stand-bys of a pyrotechnics show , a lot of dumb dialogue , and an ending that is unlikely to satisfy many . the final scene isn't the problem ; it's the one that immediately precedes it . this is so dumb that i felt like yelling at the screen . the big payoff in needful things is a gyp , and it takes the rest of the film down a couple of notches . those that sit through this picture deserve more than they're given . it's too bad about the climax , because the bulk of the overly-long film shows promise . there are the usual horror staples , like the meat cleaver in the head and the shock-tactic swell of music , but most of the story is scripted with the intelligent viewer in mind , and the villain of the piece never dirties his hands . max von sydow is an inspired casting choice , and the performance he turns in is by far the best thing about needful things . he manages a kind of gentlemanly wickedness that keeps the audience off-balance . he's the bad guy , all right--there's never any doubt about that--but he's so cultured and smooth , and delivers the one-liners so bitingly , that it's almost impossible not to have a sneaking admiration for him . certainly , it's von sydow's rendering of gaunt that keeps the movie from becoming tedious . ed harris , bonnie bedelia , and amanda plummer have shown great ability in the past , but none of that is evident here . plummer is so bad that she comes close to creating a caricature . harris , who's supposed to be playing the heroic lawman , is about as potent as a limp noodle . if he hasn't done so well with three of the four main actors , at least first-time feature director fraser c . heston ( son of charlton ) can boast excellent cinematography ( by tony westman ) and a creepy atmosphere . needful things consistently looks nice , even during its most banal scenes . some of the choppy pacing is clearly heston's fault , but the editor cannot absolve himself entirely of blame . sadly , the same ability is not in evidence here , where doyle reworks his dead again music into an overwrought theme that , at best , does little for the film . there are a couple of effective musical sequences , but neither uses doyle's work , instead relying on "" ave maria "" and grieg's "" in the hall of the mountain king "" . needful things is another example of a good idea gone awry . since i'm not a fan of mr . king and can't claim to more than occasionally read his work , it's difficult for me to say whether or not this trait is indicative of his books . whatever the case , in leland gaunt , needful things wastes one of the year's most intriguing villains . this is a case of a film building to an apex that isn't there . by the time the end credits roll , a lot of people will be wondering if that was really everything . sadly , the answer is yes , but at least the time invested is repaid in part by the fine performance of max von sydow .",JBe

"" it won't work , "" hemingway argues . the cinematography by roger pratt is handsome and warm , but the picture is content to be little more than pleasant . it is never involving . since i did not care about the characters , i resented some of the manipulative parts of the story . agnes and ernest then rig it so that jimmy wins . the love story between agnes and ernest is more hinted at than shown . i like love affairs that are believable and not ethereal . they do not have to be at all explicit to be great , see , for example , the age of innocence , but they must have enough emotional involvement to be convincing . any time you get this many people involved it is a recipe for disaster . perhaps this is the reason the story skims the surface and never invites you to go deeper . next to the miscasting of the leads , the script is the second biggest problem with the film . then there are the endings . for a while i thought the film was never going to end and that it was a special test version to see how long a dozen film critics would sit there in a dark room watching ending after ending before they gave up and left . we all stayed through the four , but a couple more and i might have been tempted to leave . at least toward the end , we do have a cheery note . i'll keep an eye on my watch waiting for that blessed event .

"" "" never give up , you wimp , "" they tell one another . this long middle section of the movie is the best part , but the two leads are so strong that the entire film is mesmerizing . but it is the hard manual labor of cleaning already clean floors in order to clean one's heart that proves the most troublesome for the rotund gustav . this gentle , good-spirited comedy does much more than make you laugh . it makes you think as well about what really is important in life . and it makes you realize that life's journeys are fraught with difficulties and opportunities . you'll leave the theater with a smile on your face and perhaps a bit more optimistic view of life . enlightenment guaranteed runs 1 : 49 . it is not rated but might be an r for brief nudity and language . it would be acceptable for teenagers . just send me a letter with the word "" subscribe "" in the subject line .",SRh
"although both women share a nicotine habit , zonca uses repetitious tight shots to dwell on isa's proclivity . i have yet to decode the precise significance of these mannerisms , but given the screen time devoted to them , they must contain important symbolism . the title is essentially a misnomer . sex with marie can be rather like a wrestling match . character-driven movies like this succeed based on how compelling the characters are , and neither of the leads here ever manage to draw us into the story . the director makes especially uninspired choices in the staging . the result is that , at the end , when the film finally tries to engage the audience , we've long since lost interest . this is the exactly the problem with the movie . it mopes around most of the time with not much to say . oh well , at least the two actresses do show promise even with such bland material . the film is in french with english subtitles . it is not rated but would probably be an r for sex , nudity and profanity . the movie would be fine for older teenagers .",SRh
"apparently , it isn't enough for a plague to be the villain . the problem with outbreak is that extraneous plot elements like donald sutherland's general , a couple of aerial chases , and an unbelievably contrived search for a monkey , keep getting in the way of a chilling horror story . in this film , we're given tantalizing glimpses of that scenario , but the need to interject action and adventure for a momentary thrill robs outbreak of dramatic power . yes , this movie is an entertaining and sometimes wildly-exhilarating ride . the helicopter chase sequence is thrilling--only it doesn't seem to belong here . and , when the movie is over , any more-than-cursory consideration of the plot reveals gaps that even sizable doses of coincidence and contrivance can't completely fill . outbreak is not one of those pictures that improves in retrospect . but in 1995 , it shows up again , only this time it's not restricted to africa . as directed by accomplished film maker wolfgang petersen ( in the line of fire , das boot ) , outbreak is a beautifully photographed , competently-acted piece . dustin hoffman is carefully contained as daniels , never straying over the top . cuba gooding jr . gives a stable , if sometimes cliched performance , as the "" sidekick .

"when i was a kid , i used to love monster movies of all kinds : frankenstein , dracula , king kong . . . had i seen anaconda when i was 9 or 10 , or even 13 or 14 , i probably would have enjoyed it . since then , however , my standards have changed , and motion pictures like this one don't look nearly as good . i still appreciate frankenstein , dracula , and king kong ( all of which have characters , solid plots , and style ) , but the bared fangs and crushed bodies of anaconda are no longer sufficient . the relatively thin plot centers around a documentary film crew venturing deep into the amazon to make a movie about the discovery of a lost tribe . much of the first half of anaconda is devoted to building tension between the human characters as sarone makes it apparent that he's less interested in helping the film crew than in pursuing his own ends . by the time the serpent -- a forty foot monster capable of ( and willing to ) swallow a human whole -- makes its first significant appearance , it's anti-climactic . anaconda is trying to be a jaws for the '90s , but , like last year's the ghost and the darkness , it falls short in several key areas . the biggest flaw can be summed up in a short phrase : lack of excitement . thrillers are supposed to be crammed with thrills ( hence the name ) , but anaconda is relatively barren of them . why ? the first reason has to do with character development . the men and women populating anaconda are uninteresting types . such obligatory , wooden personalities are incapable of exciting our imagination or our sympathy . by the time the carnage starts , we're strangely detached from the would-be heroes . another serious problem is that the snake doesn't make an especially good monster . it doesn't have much of a personality , doesn't appear particularly clever or calculating , and isn't really all that menacing ( it can get killed by a shotgun ) . on top of that , it looks like a special effect , and sometimes a rather cheesy one . the animatronic anaconda is okay , but the digitally composed version looks exactly like what it is : computer generated . many of the actors appear to be on hand mostly to collect a paycheck . jennifer lopez , who was so impressive in selena , dutifully plods through her role here without exhibiting any real spark or energy . eric stoltz and ice tea quickly fade into the background , where they're all-but-forgotten by the script . it's not a landmark performance , but it is one of anaconda's redeeming features . director louis llosa ( the specialist ) doesn't seem well suited to direct this sort of movie . for too long , he's more interested in the dead calm-like situation on the movie makers' boat than in what's lurking out in the jungle . the snake is not effectively mythologized , and its first appearance occurs without much fanfare . the picture has a solid enough premise for a monster movie ; the film makers just didn't do a very good job converting it to the screen . as a result , while anaconda offers a few momentary jolts and a rash of goosebumps for ophidiophobics , it never comes close to taking your breath away .",JBe

"" if this is an accurate description , then the word has undergone a radical devaluation . the 1961 movie was , at best , a mildly-amusing diversion . granted , it probably wasn't any worse than most of disney's other live- action offerings , but that hardly qualifies it as a "" classic . "" of course , disney has taken to using that term for just about everything they produce , deserving or not . i'm not going to spend much time comparing the original the absent- minded professor with director les mayfield's updated version . both are equally dopey , but , in large part because of the inclusion of robin williams ( taking on the fred mcmurray part ) , flubber has its share of genuinely funny moments , whereas the best the absent-minded professor could manage was an occasional chuckle or two . the special effects are obviously greatly improved , and the script has made allowances for the 36-year time shift . watching the 1961 movie now is a good reminder of how much society has changed . in fact , there are times when this movie feels like the latest installment in the over-milked home alone saga . although obviously a brilliant scientist , phillip has a little personality defect : he's forgetful . actually , that's understating the situation -- he's not just absentminded , he's a senile fruitcake . it doesn't matter that phillip has what he believes to be a valid excuse ; she's not interested in hearing any more lame explanations . the reason phillip missed the wedding is because he made the scientific discovery of a lifetime -- something he calls "" flubber . "" a jello-like green goo , flubber has the ability to energize anything it comes into contact with . put some of the glop on a golf ball and it will bounce higher than the tree-tops . people with flubber-coated sneakers can jump so high that they're almost flying . most of the humor in flubber is sophomoric , but that doesn't mean it isn't funny . the film has its share of laugh-aloud scenes , many of which are fueled by robin williams' antics . there's also a moment of explosive flatulence that had almost everyone in the audience in stitches . this is standard john hughes stuff , and he has used it too many times . it worked in home alone , but has become progressively more tiresome since then . what's so funny about a guy being repeatedly whacked on the head with a bowling ball ? one of the more innovative aspects of the film is a romantic subplot involving the professor's levitating robot assistant/companion/friend , weebo ( voiced by the little mermaid , jodi benson ) , who is infatuated with phillip . in fact , there's more chemistry between williams and this floating computer than there is between him and his female co-star , marcia gay harden . personally , i was rooting for phillip to get together with weebo in the end . aside from the jokes that work and a typically high-energy performance by robin williams , flubber doesn't have much to recommend it . the creature , a special effects masterpiece , is cute to look at , but doesn't have much of a personality . the bad guys are typically uninteresting , and the phillip/sara romance is trite . the worst thing about the movie , however , is the low intelligence level of the script . the best family films have something for members of all different age groups ; flubber is aimed exclusively at the under-10 crowd . if that describes your mental or physical age , you'll probably be hugely entertained . more discriminating viewers may get a few laughs out of the film , but little else . in plundering its own history , disney has come up with yet another exercise in mediocrity .

"another formula 'feel good' quirky comedy from the british isles , much like "" waking ned devine , "" and a host of other popular low budget movies that turned a nifty profit off a thin story line . it is filled with likable establishment types living in a quaint town , such as tolerant vicars and policemen , plenty of eccentrics , and of locals who stick together through thick and thin . the strength of this film lies in its rational theme , that smoking pot should be legalized since it is even less dangerous than drinking alcohol . the film is tolerable until after its first hour , it then falls completely apart , becoming just too absurd to consider as anything but sitcom fluff gone completely bananas . but its long overdue message of decriminalization for certain drugs is on target and allows the film to , at least , be viewed as containing a pertinent message . its message is especially appropriate nowadays considering the 'war on drugs' is about to be escalated into colombia . everything about this proposed action smacks of vietnam , with this scenario closer to home , so what probably awaits such an effort is a more futile result than the other war . the film's mild theme of showing squares getting into the weed business and finding it acceptable by the public , something that should have been accepted some 40 years ago , is a theme long overdue for public acceptance , but one that is better received late than never . there has to be some common sense in distinguishing what drugs should be legalized and how to educate the public on this , rather than making it a police matter altogether . it is interesting to note , that no one thinks smoking grass is bad for you , only that one can go to jail . things work out in a ridiculous way , where there is a total breakdown in the character development of grace , where this matronly figure suddenly becomes merely a cartoon figure instead of live flesh and blood . there are a lot of silly giggles that come forth and the film has just enough of an acting performance by brenda blethyn to breathe air into it before it comes to its belated finale , as it drones on with its transparently gratuitous upbeat tone , until it makes the audience feel good that the sweet old lady succeeded . ummm !",DSc

"" the major stumbling block , to this otherwise involving film , is the let down in the third act . the action in it seemed obligatory and not really germane to the story , as an anonymous psycho serial killer is introduced to prove that david has the super-powers of the comic book hero . this encounter , of him stopping the violent psychopath killer never worked right , as it seemed flat and arbitrary , spoiling but not ruining the overall achievement of the film . what this unconventional mainstream film did right for itself , was to provide a modern type of super-hero for an audience that thrives on escapist films that can fill them with some hope that there's a savior out there in the fight between good and evil ( something hollywood films could always be counted on to provide the public with ) . it is a film that is confident enough of its ability to tell its story that it doesn't have to rely on special effects . and , perhaps , as an homage to hitchcock or maybe it's a case of egomania , night once again appears in his own film .",DSc
"screenplay : fran walsh , peter jackson . director : peter jackson . all those who worried that peter jackson's first big studio film would be a sell-out , please step forward to receive your slaps on the wrist . yes , it is true that many independent and international directors have found that their first steps into hollywood left something foul on the bottom of their shoes ( see kevin smith's mallrats , lee tamahori's mulholland falls or john dahl's unforgettable for just the most recent examples ) . jackson's direction is still in top form in the frighteners , a comedy-thriller which , amazingly , works as both . unfortunately , his story and casting choices are not quite up to the task . it's a cozy little arrangement , but it soon becomes clear that there are other supernatural goings on in fairwater . robert zemeckis acted as executive producer of the frighteners , and if you remember his death becomes her , you will have a good idea of what to expect . the visual effects are wild and entertaining , and sometimes decidedly creepy , like an ectoplasmic face which slowly drips down a tombstone . hartman character from full metal jacket as a ghost running a very tight graveyard . the first half of the frighteners is a feast for those with a warped sense of humor , particularly those who have no problem with the idea of the decomposing judge enjoying . . . ummm . . . relations with a mummy in an egyptian museum exhibit . the main problem with the second half , quite surprisingly , turns out _not_ to be the shift from comedy to horror ; in fact , it's not so much a shift as a gradual build-up . bizarre comedy is a part of the frighteners throughout , but the suspense elements become ever more significant , until the conclusion becomes a sometimes rather bloody confrontation between frank and a pair of killers including a wonderfully unhinged dee wallace stone . jackson knows how to make an audience giggle and shiver at the same time , and it all blends into one creepy funhouse ride . no , the problem , quite simply is michael j . fox , or rather the decision to include a sub-plot for which fox is really unsuited . other characters keep telling frank -- and us -- that he is haunted by that event , but fox never manages to make frank seem like anything more than a happily sleazy con man . his attempts at showing emotional turmoil are sadly superficial ; i don't think i've ever seen someone look as thoroughly unconvincing while a glycerine tear rolled down his cheek . the back story for frank is just one of many bits and pieces which jackson and co-writer fran walsh pile onto the frighteners , making it feel like just that -- bits and pieces . with serial killers , gun-toting ghosts , lunatic g-men , snooping reporters and love interests all running around , the frighteners sometimes gets far too busy for its own good . by the time we get to a finale which includes visions of the afterlife ( both the good and bad version ) , it actually seems just plain silly . peter jackson has a welcome quality in a director , which is that he always wants to keep his audience on its toes , never quite knowing what to expect , and he is ready to entertain them any way he knows how . the frighteners is ultimately a satisfying ride which shows that hollywood hasn't shaken the life out of jackson ; now jackson needs to shake some of the loose ends out of his scripts .",SRe
"the interest in the show is provided by hurt's character more than the boy's although the script was written , i think , to have the movie center around the boy . the scenes where the boys trashes his house and he just stares without speaking were a bit much even for his withdrawn character . i did not buy these scenes . on the whole though , hurt plays it very convincingly , and you feel really sorry for him . the main problem in the show for me was the casting of the boy . he was supposed to be an enigma , but he carried it overboard . during most of the movie it was hard to understand anything at all about what the boy was feeling and hence hard to empathize with him . the director ( chris menges ) should have realized this and given him better guidance . all of the minor characters were quite good except the role played by john hurt ( no relation to william ) which seemed to be out of another movie . my favorite minor character was jane horrocks's portrayal of the social worker . she was the only funny character in the movie and every one of her lines was a riot . i wish her part had been made larger . given that everyone loved her in life is sweet whereas i hated her in it , i was surprised myself at how enchanted i was with her acting in second best . just watching the movie may make you want to move to the serenity of wales - lovely cinematography ( ashley rowe ) . a lot of the movie was either sad or disturbing because of the subject matter . the movie runs 1 : 45 and is rated pg-13 for self-inflicted bloody wounds and some frightening subject matter . i think it would be okay for mature teenagers . i recommend this serious movie to you and give  .",SRh

"producers : clint eastwood , karen spiegel . director : clint eastwood . when we first encounter luther whitney ( clint eastwood ) in absolute power , he is sitting in an art gallery sketching hands and eyes from paintings in one of those slow , silent moments characteristic of an eastwood-directed film . at that moment , you may be tempted to break into a slight smile , impressed that eastwood has merely fleshed out his character under the guise of plot development . perhaps , you think , this won't be just another plot-driven conspiracy thriller . perhaps three-dimensional characters are going to make it something special . just wait sixty seconds . luther manages to escape , but the president's people know there was a witness . almost any other director would have taken this material and made it a big , dumb hollywood thriller -- and frankly , that probably would have been the best thing for it . eastwood is a director with a precise control over the details of his films , but in absolute power he spends so much time fussing over those details that he fails to notice that the story is completely absurd . while eastwood is able to construct clockwork sequences like an ambush at a coffee shop , he doesn't seem to care that , like much of what goes on in absolute power , it is resolved through pure coincidence . even the casting manages to get in the way , specifically the casting of hackman as richmond . the press notes for absolute power boast of hackman's career that "" there is no such thing as a 'gene hackman role , ' "" but that simply isn't true . it is also hard to figure out how the pathetic , libidinous drunkard of that opening scene becomes the take-charge whip-cracker , or why his press conference in support of his grieving friend sullivan demonstrates such a lousy poker face you wonder what kind of politician this guy could possibly be . the script , by the legendary william goldman , does offer a few nice touches and typically snappy dialogue , and ed harris plays the detective investigating the murder as a courtly and respectful spin on the usual foul-mouthed cop . when a central character seems to be a different person from scene to scene , however , those little details lose a lot of their charm . that brings us to eastwood's luther whitney , as baffling a screen character as i can recall . eastwood's acting has grown more interesting with the passing years , more relaxed and subtle , but he has devoted nearly every ounce of energy in the creation of absolute power to making his own character sympathetic . never mind that before that scene we had no indication that whitney even knew the man in the sullivan house was the president ; in fact , the scene plays funnier and more interesting if whitney is such a recluse that he doesn't even know what the president looks like . but everything is subjugated to giving luther the moral high ground , making him a doting father and a good citizen with a handful of quirky traits . i'm willing to grant the conceit that whitney is a master of disguise even though it doesn't seem particularly necessary for a sneak thief -- maybe he needed a hobby when he tired of sketching the old masters in the smithsonian -- but absolute power lost me when it became clear that this man who could disarm any security system in the world couldn't program a vcr for his alibi .",SRe

"saying that tin cup may be the best-ever "" golf motion picture "" isn't exactly high praise , considering the competition ( caddyshack , happy gilmore ) , but it's true nonetheless . in fact , as sports movies go ( regardless of the sport ) , this one turns in a respectable showing , injecting some intelligence and maturity into a story that easily could have succumbed to a flood of "" struggling underdog "" cliches . that's not to say that elements of the formula aren't here , but they rarely threaten to overwhelm tin cup's better aspects . when it comes to making sports movies , no one has shown more aptitude than ron shelton , whose writing and directing credits include films about baseball ( bull durham , cobb ) , basketball ( blue chips , white men can't jump ) , football ( the best of times ) , boxing ( the great white hype ) , and now golf . however , while romantic subplots are frequently used as side dishes for motion picture athletic contests , shelton keeps the two disparate elements of his movie on equal footing , which lends a sense of balance to the finished product . one of the most laudable characteristics of tin cup is that the script never condescends to either of the main characters . these aren't two mismatched caricatures engaging in a series of familiar romantic moves . crisp , thoughtful dialogue replaces the empty banter we've become accustomed to in screen love stories . there's a believability and depth to both kevin costner's roy "" tin cup "" mcavoy and rene russo's molly griswold , and the understated manner in which they relate to each other is a welcome change-of-pace during this season of loud , ostentatious explosions . and , while the chemistry between costner and russo doesn't sizzle , they work together in a comfortable , relaxed manner . to the men of salome , the concept of a female doctor is a revelation , and , in one of the film's more slyly amusing scenes , they watch eagerly as roy teaches her the basics of hitting a golf ball , wondering how "" such a pretty girl can have such an ugly swing .

"it's an absorbing story but it was presented in such a mangled way , so a lot of the drama was sucked out of it and it instead became an obvious sob story about an injustice done . this steven zaillian directed film has traces of the same intelligence he has shown in his previous work as director of searching for bobby fischer and as a screenwriter for schindler's list , but loses its fire-power with scenes of endless court hagglings and what seems like an interminable amount of time spent in giving prep classes on how the court system works . this sets-up a battle of david versus goliath . the supporting players all have limited roles compared to the two gunslingers , travolta and duvall , but perform admirably . for all its telling faults in its storytelling ability , the film had an aura of reality about it that the john grisham movies never have . while duvall is shown as the masterful machiavellian tactician with absolutely no heart , whose m . o . what the film failed to do , is to bring a sense of urgency to their presentation . though they were sympathetic to the families' plight and caught the essence of what travolta was up against , which makes it better than most hollywood films , it just couldn't drive the fastball thrown down the middle of the plate over the 'green monster' in fenway park for a home run . the story became less than compelling and more of an exercise about who was the better actor/lawyer duvall or travolta . the great social impact of the lawsuit never caught on during the film , when that should have been the driving force of the film , as it was when grippingly told in the book .",DSc

"even the name before the film has changed , with disney shuttling the sequel from its flagship banner to dimension , the genre division of miramax ( apparently realizing the original had too few fart jokes to qualify as a live-action disney film ) . i only wish that with all those changes they could have rustled up a new screenwriting team . naturally this leads to amusing sequences of buddy befuddling opposing defenses as he makes like jerry rice . but wait , there's more ! the original air bud had good intentions and solid family values to spare , but it tied them up in such derivative and unfocused package that even the kids in the audience couldn't keep their attention on the precocious pooch . new director richard martin picks up the pace considerably this time around , but he can't do much to create any cohesiveness with this story . from moment to moment , it's hard to tell whether air bud : golden receiver is supposed to be an afterschool special , a john hughes film or an episode of rocky and bullwinkle ( though with considerably less wit ) . it's also hard to take seriously a film where a premise so bizarre is shrugged off as a given . this time around , buddy trots onto the field in his leather helmet and shoulder pads as though it were the most natural thing in the world . perhaps somewhere on the cutting room floor is a scene in which an arbitrator cites the "" air bud "" precedent . without such a scene , everything that follows seems a little insulting to the intelligence , and an indication of how lazy the screenwriters were that they couldn't come up with some creative way to land buddy on the team . i'm not pretending that air bud : golden receiver was made with me in mind . this one is a short attention span kiddie-caper which did have the young ones clapping and guffawing with some regularity , and perhaps that counts for something . it even features a few decent throwaway gags , including a llama named dolly and a splendidly off-key rendition of the american national anthem . there's just something vaguely desperate about this whole air bud franchise -- they have build not just one film but a series of them on what amounts to a better-than-average stupid pet trick . sure , it's harmless enough , but the frantic amalgamation of disparate elements gave me a headache . it's a bit frightening to note that the original buddy's trainer kevin dicicco is putting together another project , air bud : the next generation . perhaps in the course of teaching a new dog a new trick , he could teach a new screenwriting team one i'd really love to see : how to write a script that might appeal to someone over the age of five . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line "" subscribe "" .",SRe
"fear of a black hat is the 1990s version of this is spinal tap , skewering rap music on the same stake that rob reiner used to impale heavy metal . for three-quarter of its running length , this is a first- rate parody of the most bawdy kind . it is unapologetically politically incorrect , and some of the biggest laughs come at the most off-color jokes . there's virtually no stone in the world of rap music left unturned by black hat , which has something to say about everything from drug dealing and gun violence to the new wave of black film directors . as was the case with spinal tap , the premise behind fear of a black hat is that someone is doing a documentary . the film opens with a warning to the audience that fear of a black hat will make use of a number of potentially offensive terms , but does not intend to do so gratuitously . it then repeats each of those words several times , and prints them on the screen for good measure . from this moment on , we know that we're in the hands of an accomplished satirist , and the result is predictably better than other feeble efforts such as cb4 and those elements of the wayne's world movies which tried something similar . from that point on , the jokes come faster than the uses of the word . the parodies of rap videos are inspired--writer/director rusty cundieff injects an mtv-like glamor , but makes sure that each possesses all sorts of excesses . with titles like "" guerrillas in the midst "" and "" my peanuts "" with lyrics that will not be reprinted here , cundieff has found rich ground to hoe . almost every facet of the rap culture gets similar treatment . a marquee in chicago refuses to use the word "" niggaz , "" so it calls nwh "" negroes with hats . "" certain well-known personalities don't escape cundieff's attention , either . i wonder which two prominent directors he could represent ? ) , the black filmmaker who gives ice cold his feature film debut . the humor of fear of a black hat rolls along nicely for about an hour before beginning to sputter and fizzle . the last quarter of the movie is uneven , and seems like an attempt to stretch a concept beyond its natural playing time . there aren't many notable moments in the final twenty minutes until the end credits start scrolling . using parody as its means , fear of a black hat has a lot to say about the exploitation that surrounds the rap music business . this movie is not tightly-scripted or elegantly produced , but it is ( for the most part ) highly entertaining . for those who have been waiting for a sequel to spinal tap , this may be the best alternative .",JBe
"screenplay : woody allen . director : woody allen . mpaa rating : r ( profanity , sexual situations , adult themes ) running time : 113 minutes . woody allen's detractors have had a laundry list of gripes about his films for many years now . his neurotic screen persona had grown increasingly shrill and annoying , they said ; his cinematic world of white upper-manhattanites had grown ever more insular . as the lines between his convoluted personal life and his baldly autobiographical films grew blurrier by the year , the anti-woody contingent began to consider him a vaguely pathetic has-been , the film-making equivalent of frank sinatra -- more famous in the later stages of his career for who he used to be than for who he still was . it took watching kenneth branagh's grating gloss on allen's mannerisms in celebrity for me to sympathize with that side of the great woody debate . it's easy to see the potential in celebrity for exploring the foibles of fame and the absurdity of a culture that bestows fame for all the wrong reasons . unfortunately , lee is never a remotely sympathetic character , primarily because branagh is too preoccupied with mimicking the woodman to find anything true in the character . judy davis is more effective as the emotionally fragile robin , but her character arc is only slightly more compelling . the film's two central characters are contrivances ; worse , they're often annoying contrivances , twisted knots of self-doubt and self-loathing whose happiness couldn't matter less to us . without any emotional center , celebrity becomes a series of stand-alone vignettes about the strange and self-absorbed things famous people do . allen can still manage to pull out a few one-line zingers ( including self-deprecating takes on "" pretentious film-makers who shoot everything in black-and-white "" ) , but they're few and far between in this film . sequences that should build to a great comic payoff , like lee's wild night with dicaprio's bad boy actor , just seem to drag on until it's time to start the next scene . the lack of invention in celebrity gives you plenty of time to notice how stale allen's act has become . for every decent gag ( a film producer referring to his next project , "" an all-black version of 'birth of a nation' "" ) , there are half a dozen that turned up in a previous woody allen film . celebrity , a film which should have been wonderfully timely in the daytime talk show era , shows little cutting-edge satiric bite . perhaps it's even more ironic that he's showing himself to be one of those famous people so far removed from ordinary life that he doesn't know what we might find absurd , or that he himself may now be one of those people famous for all the wrong reasons . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line "" subscribe "" .",SRe
"looking for richard is al pacino's paean to shakespeare and to acting . the picture is totally his baby . he conceived it , and it is the first film he ever directed . the film , for reasons described below , is a frustrating , but ultimately rewarding cinematic experience . let me deal first with the single and almost fatal problem with the film and then i can get to the good part . never i have i seen bad editing detract from a film more than it does here . the movie is about the acting of the play richard iii . this is a technique that holds much promise , but the editing almost sinks it . this makes for an extremely choppy and dizzying experience . perhaps this sound bite technique works on mtv , but not with discussions of shakespeare . after being convinced i was seeing a film that going to find me with my thumb down , the second part is edited at a pace that allows us to hear the play , the rehearsals , and listen to the opinions so that in the end the picture redeems itself and does end up transferring to the audience an appreciation of the acting profession in general and shakespeare in particular . as proof of its success , i left the theater wanting to see the play live again soon and to see ian mckellen's marvelous movie richard iii ( 1995 ) once more . let me give you a taste of looking for richard . pacino talks about the problems of american actors and the bard saying , "" what's this thing that gets between us and shakespeare ? "" one actress explains to us about shakespearean rules , "" there are certain rules like iambic pentameter that must be learned , and once learned can be rejected .

"" i think i'll save that quote and use it on the next hundred people that write me with personal insults when i have the bad taste not to like their favorite little movie . most of the scholars added little over the actors' opinions , but i did like one who said that , "" an irony is really only an hypocrisy with style .

"he has taught film at columbia university and nyu , and has said that he made this film because he can't remember as a youth watching films that were made in chile . the film was written spontaneously while at the workshop to fit the emotions of the teenage actors recruited . it's a familiar theme about teenage alienation , as the story suffers at times from being strained . also , there are raw emotional scenes that are difficult to watch when they are extended for too long . but what prevents this one from just being a clich ? teenager film , is that they are presented as genuine teens even if they are not that appealing and the story might not be compelling to everyone--especially those who watch such loud kids in public places and are turned off by them ( i guess that would include me in that category ) . the film is political in nature and it should be best understood by the teens now living in chile who are familiar with the social climate in their home turf . the teens grapple with their frustrations and loneliness , and mature somewhat by the film's end . this seemed to be what the audience was rooting for to happen , as they were obnoxious but not bad sorts .",DSc
"but , in the contender , the extremely impressive second feature film by writer and director rod lurie ( deterrence ) , there is at least one politician for whom principles are more important than politics , even if her integrity costs her the honor of being the nation's first female vice president . speaking of honors , expect to see this political thriller and morality tale garner many well deserved oscar nominations including , but not limited to , best actress ( joan allen ) and best supporting actor ( gary oldman ) . "" principles only mean something if you stick to them when it's inconvenient , "" she explains with utter sincerity . allen , in a consistently strong performance , never lets senator hanson dissolve into self-righteousness . she gives a sympathetic performance that doesn't require sympathy to admire . but it's more than that . the sharply written script mixes heavy drama with sweet comedy . it's a great life , and he's making the most of it . bridges's charismatic performance is full of nuances and subtlety that leaves us never quite sure of his motivations . surprisingly , the president brushes his candidacy aside , claiming that someone might decide that his heroism was actually another chappaquidick episode . the congressman is at once utterly polite and completely devious . no matter how unlikable runyon becomes , oldman never lets him dissolve into caricature . she wants to talk nothing but policy at her hearings -- the usual liberal litany of ban all handguns , abolish the death penalty and guarantee a woman's right to choose . all of the casting in this ensemble effort is terrific . lurie's staging is masterful , even if sometimes a bit over the top . the beauty of the story is that we keep waiting for more shoes to drop . some of them do , but others we expect to , don't . and still others drop , but turn out not to be what we expect . my only complaint is that one key twist is needlessly telegraphed . the movie itself is no enigma . its principles are crystal clear and dramatically demonstrated . the contender is all the president's men for our time . it is rated r for strong sexual content and language and would be fine for most teenagers .",SRh

"it stridently shows in its futuristic prediction what the united states might become like if the reactionary right-wing had their way . it is a polemic exercise between the left and the right , with no room for the middle point of view . though the director tries to present some of the establishments' arguments against these young dissenters to show that he is impartial , the weight of what is going down is so heavy , that even when the tribunal members make a plausible response , it still sounds vacuous given the current situation . they mostly say things like the protesters don't care about this country , that the vietnam war is a "" just "" war because it is aimed to stop the spread of communism , and that the protesters are trying to make a mockery of the american way of life . that the politician is nothing but a debater . while the pacifists' say that war is only just when it is entered into without any hatred in one's heart . the honorable thing to do at a crisis time like this , is be a criminal -- that at another time it might be to become a politician . the film had a gritty look to it and should bring back some of the worst confrontational memories of a time the country was divided in a very hostile way . what was missing from the film , was a sense that it could accomplish anything . but , maybe , that wasn't possible , especially looking at this film some thirty years later and realizing how there was no way to justify the war and the racism at the time . to add to that the fictional suspension of individual rights and a horror chamber like punishment park , makes this film seem like a futile diatribe that lost its prospective of what its aim was . yet , if the film's polemics disturbs , but fails to entertain as a film , it still had some bite in it , and its non-professional cast made this an unusual film , one worth watching for all the intensity it displayed despite its inability to alter any one's mind from their current views . it is , simply , preaching to the choir .",DSc

"writer and director gary ross , the writer and creator of big and dave , delights audiences once again with his best fantasy ever in pleasantville . like most teens , they blow all of this off , worrying more about their own popularity at school than the issues of the day . reese witherspoon delivers a dead-on performance as a sarcastic teen , who is aghast to be thrown into the plastic 1950s . the whole first half of the movie , as the kids cope and alter their new environment , is comedy at its best . intelligently written , the film's first part produces such a stream of laughter that you may need a second viewing to catch all the spoken humor and sight gags . breakfast , which is in danger of touching the ceiling , consists of stacks of dozens of pancakes , waffles , and toast . everything , absolutely everything , has always gone perfectly in pleasantville . like most television facades , there are a few things missing , like toilets in the bathroom stalls and words in the books , but the townsfolk don't mind . the movie explores change through the power of reading as well as sex . it is too bad that pleasantville had to come out the same year as the truman show since they will inevitably be compared . next to an almost perfect film like the truman show , pleasantville isn't as quite as good , having many fewer memorable lines for one and lacking the talent of a jim carrey for another , but this should not be allowed to detract from the incredible brilliance of pleasantville . as dazzlingly filmed by john lindley in a gorgeous black and white , the movie slowly develops color in small places like roses and tongues , until it bursts into a bouquet of saturated colors by the end . how and why things turn color is one of the mysteries that the story slowly reveals . at first the reason seems simple and almost trite , and then the complete rationale behind the colorization becomes the story's key turning point . visually it is a stunning technical achievement . once color appears in this innovative film , women's make-up is shown to be able to take on an entirely different role . starting as a hilarious comedy , the story transforms carefully into a serious satire on life's insanities . although it starts off as a romp , the film ends up with more messages than you can count , all of them delivered delicately but powerfully . part science fiction , the story asks the age-old question of what would happen to the future if you could alter the past ? moreover , would the results be what you expect and want ? david worries about this a lot , but jennifer is more interested in freeing the people from their chains and the consequences be damned . the movie contains many great small performances . the story has many surprises . you yell "" cat !

"at a time when children are reading less , opting instead for such fast , furious , and empty entertainment as video games and mtv , it falls to a movie , the pagemaster , to make the case for books . this clever , often engaging , and always fast-paced motion picture uses the visual medium to encourage its viewers to reach out with their imagination . they may not be as visibly transformed as macaulay culkin's richard tyler , but through the magic of page-turning , they can enter different worlds--or at least that's the message this release is trying to convey . jekyll and mr . if the sight of culkin's animated image making his way through these adventures isn't enough to pique the reading curiosity of the average youngster , it's hard to imagine what will . technically , the movie isn't an unqualified triumph . while the live action special effects are impressive , the animation appears somewhat rushed . it's certainly not the worst to have graced the big screen in the past few years ( that distinction probably goes to ferngully ) , but certain sequences , most notably those involving the pagemaster--who resembles gandalf from the animated the hobbit--look unfinished . on the other hand , the fire-breathing dragon is suitably imposing and menacing . with its curious mix of time bandits-like enchantment and plain sense of fun , the pagemaster represents the least-annoying and most enjoyable contribution culkin has made to the industry since home alone . this won't be the monster hit that movie was , but children venturing into the pagemaster should be no less beguiled . grownups who often feel insulted by the too-juvenile tone of most so-called "" family features "" will likely find this movie long enough to catch their attention , but short enough not to lose it--in essence , a surprisingly affable ( and occasionally even sophisticated ) movie-going experience .",JBe

"a few years ago , i saw a production of "" les miserables "" in san francisco , and i loved it . i loved the experience of being in that theater , and of giving myself over to the spectacle and the energy of that live performance . some time later , it occurred to me that if i had seen the identical production on a movie screen , i probably would have laughed myself silly at its bombast . only this : live theater and film are not the same animal , and what works in one does not necessarily work in the other . vanya on 42nd street is a great stage production , but as a film it is simply good . the framing device , which shows the cast members and director andre gregory walking down bustling new york streets towards the theater , is clearly intended to establish a relevance of vanya in the modern day . to the extent that it succeeds , that connection is really about living a life in the theater . from the moment when the actors imperceptibly begin the production with the line , "" your looks have faded , "" this vanya becomes a kind of purgation of the agonies of being an actor , and the characters come to represent very recognizable types . the years of rehearsal and refinement show in performances which are effortless almost to a one . however , perhaps the most wrenching performance belongs to brooke smith , who tears into sonya with an emotional ferocity few actors could muster . her two scenes with moore are powerfully played , and when she broke down i felt tears welling in my eyes . it is as good a performance by a supporting actress as you'll see this year . all these things vanya on 42nd street does exceedingly well , but while i was sitting in my seat watching it on a screen , i often felt more distanced than i should have felt . louis malle's choices in framing shots are not particularly inspired , and cinematographer declan quinn's camera teeters for no apparent reason , creating that verite vertigo pioneered by woody allen's husbands and wives . to put it bluntly , i couldn't quite figure out why this film had been made . i started to become annoyed that i couldn't be one of the lucky few who was able to see this production in the flesh , and i wondered why these actors who were obviously so dedicated to this play hadn't considered touring with it . vanya on 42nd street is a superior interpretation of a fantastic play , but i couldn't quite shake the conviction that i really should have seen it * on * 42nd street .",SRe

"" the only time twilight's screenplay truly shines is when it contemplates questions of age and mortality . normally , mystery/thrillers have younger , stronger protagonists -- not white- haired retirees who have to worry about prostate problems . if nothing else , twilight captures a slice of the melancholia associated with growing old . emmet walsh ) -- only this guy has blood leaking from several bullet holes in his body . twilight is classic potboiler stuff , and it's easy to figure out how things are going to turn out in the end . the few twists and surprises are obvious and the seams are visible in the pedestrian screenplay . still , although the story isn't likely to stave off boredom , newman's acting accomplishes that . this isn't the actor's best work , but , even not in peak form , he is adept enough at his craft to create an engaging personality . sarandon is a wonderfully mature-yet-sultry femme fatale , garner is enjoyable as one of harry's old friends , and witherspoon is fresh and sexy . the only one who rubbed me the wrong way is giancarlo esposito , who plays a fatuous would-be sidekick . twilight drips atmosphere . even though it's a contemporary tale , it has the feel of something set forty or fifty years ago . but stylistic photography and solid acting aren't everything , and there are only so many plot imperfections such assets can mask . twilight should have been a better movie . it's rare that this much talent is assembled for a single production , and it seems criminal to waste it in this manner . with a lesser cast , the film would have been easy to shrug off . but with this bunch , although the final product is undeniably better than it would have been with a group of secondary performers , the aftertaste is vaguely bitter .

"few people who have seen the classic 12 angry men from 1957 will ever be able to forget it . the film itself has a history of which only the most avid cinema buffs are aware . the secret is that the 1957 movie is a direct adaptation of a live television production from 1954 . the production won three major emmy awards -- best director for franklin schaffner , best actor for robert cummings , and most of all , best writer for reginald rose . rose's script would be used with minor changes but no substantial improvements in the 1957 movie as well as the 1997 television remake . i went to the museum of television and radio in manhattan to view the original 1954 production . besides the facilities for viewing just about any old television program imaginable , they have several different collections being shown simultaneously on movie sized screens . my favorites of the latter were an anthology of science fiction in television over the past forty years and one featuring three classic alfred hitchcock episodes . but i digress . the plot , which looks simple , becomes anything but as the story unfolds . although the cast is perhaps not quite as strong as in the remakes , it has significant depth . among others , the cast includes robert cummings , franchot tone , edward arnold , paul hartman , john beal , and walter abel . the show starts with a dramatic charge by an excessively somber judge . "" i urge you to deliberate earnestly and thoughtfully , "" he intones with the low bass voice of a old preacher at a funeral . "" you are faced with a grave responsibility . "" most of the jurors keep their ties on and their coats buttoned , as was the custom of the time , making the heat even more insufferable . "" i've never seen a guiltier man in my life . "" some are reasonable but others stick to diatribes . the intelligent script manages to include most types of people with the racist on the jury being the most outlandish . the great testament to the quality of the story is that none of the 12 feel like cliches although many certainly are . the story has a timelessness and an honesty to it that few others can match . robert cummings plays the persistent juror who wants to slow down the process at least enough so that the young kid charged with murder gets a fair hearing in the jury room . since it was live tv one can never be sure why , but he gets his words a bit mixed up at first and almost starts to stutter . it was probably planned , and it is just the kind of realistic event that would happen in such circumstances . cummings gives the best of several outstanding performances . the production is full of theatrics such as the men's almost coming to blows , but it is presented with such honesty that it is easy to forgive its shortcomings . as the people sweat and the street sounds from outside flow into the room , every member of the viewing audience feels like they are on the jury as well . despite what you might believe , early television was generally fairly awful . studio one : twelve angry men runs probably an hour or so without the commercials . it is not rated but would be pg only for the mature themes , and the show would be fine for kids old enough to be interested . i recommend it strongly if you should ever be presented an opportunity to see it , and i give it  .",SRh

"" ah , "" some of you must be musing to yourselves , "" but isn't that scenario he just described remarkably similar to the usual suspects , a film widely praised for its cleverness ? in one extremely significant way : in the rich man's wife , the ending serves absolutely no dramatic purpose . too few critics of the usual suspects gave it credit for making keaton's desire to go legitimate a critical element in the resolution of the story ; the final revelations make him a tragic character , and there is evidence to allow us to reach different conclusions . if the revelation that the story is an complete hoax serves any purpose , it is as an excuse for suspense cliches ( see , that's what they would be _expecting_ ) or for day to turn miraculously to night for added artificial tension . there is a smug pseudo-feminism in amy holden jones' script , a sense that we should be inspired to whoops of "" you go , girls ! "" but jones denies us the chance to under-estimate them because we're never allowed to estimate them in the first place . she isn't playing with expectations or with genre conventions . she's playing us for suckers .",SRe
"screenplay : george welsh and peter jackson . director : peter jackson . earlier this year , i commented on thematically similar films where the later release suffered in comparison to the first . wyatt earp languished in the wake of the less reverent but far more entertaining tombstone ; blown away was blown away by the gleefully brainless speed . it was not a great film , but good enough that i wondered if my evaluation of heavenly creatures might be influenced . but where fun was occasionally stagy and ponderous , heavenly creatures is dazzling , a perversely original psychodrama . the strongest elements in fun were the performances of the two young lead actresses , and ironically the same elements provide the only minor weak link in heavenly creatures . melanie lynskey is the better of the two , playing the more complicated character , but it seems she settles into expressing every emotion by glowering beneath her nest of unruly dark curls ; kate winslet is occasionally a bit much , arching her eyebrows and punching her oh-so-proper upper crust diction . however , their scenes together are quite effective , and they show a natural rapport . lynskey in particular comes alive beautifully , and the intensity of their relationship never seems implausible . it is also illustrated with astonishing creativity by peter jackson , best known for the marvelously demented dead alive . from the first frames , jackson slams us into a world of chaos and delusion , and even through light-hearted scenes there is a sense of foreboding as we await the inevitable conclusion . this is the real triumph of heavenly creatures : although it is alternately a drama , a fantasy and a mystery , it is an absolutely coherent whole . because we know where this relationship will lead , there is an undercurrent of menace in dark-humored sequences where pauline visualizes revenge fantasies . it also presents the disturbing premise that given the right ( or wrong ) circumstances , the fantasy world every adolescent creates could explode into the real world . those circumstances involve a delicate issue , one also raised by fun . since there is a sexual element to the relationship between pauline and juliet , it would be possible to misinterpret the film as suggesting that their crime , leopold and loeb-like , was just another manifestation of their "" deviance .

"the conflict inside him revolves around the tremendous high he gets over saving a life- there is no better feeling , he tells us in a voiceover , his usual way of conveying to the viewer what he is thinking- and the low point is from all the depravity and hopelessness and horror he sees all around him everyday . these images become a reminder of what hell might look like . that in a nutshell is the plot of the film , as this is a story mostly about character development and the unique personalities of those who choose to work under such trying conditions , and of the uncertain relationship that develops between two kindred spirits , mary and frank . the audience is taken along for the grim ride and the entertainment comes from the constant gallows humor of these very obsessively comedic ems men , who provide the necessary breaks in the story for everyone concerned , that is audience and driver alike . things are so insane that if you don't laugh , you can succumb to the intensity of the situation by just watching it . this is a dark comedy in the real sense of being dark , with the noir style to the film provided by scorsese's frequent screenwriter , paul schrader ( taxi driver/raging bull/the last temptation of christ ) . this seems to give the patient a pulse and the family some hope . frank's way is through coffee , whiskey , vitamin shots , and living with ghosts-- and none of them work . this film is intense all right , and it drags on for much too long a look at the insane world it envisions , making its way through a grotesque looking city and a hospital that is likened to a crazy house . the misery uncovered is catching , like certain diseases are . but is it worth it ? does the film have something salient to say , as scorsese seems more comfortable in these surroundings than he did in the foreign turf of the age of innocence and kundun , for instance ? is there entertainment value in this story ? that i really don't know , but i do know that it all seemed too real and that the acting was superb , one couldn't help but get entangled in the lives of the characters , and there was a rush of adrenaline emanating from the highs and even the lows experienced . the nicolas cage performance caught the nuances of his character in a bewitching manner , as in his crazed ems role , he catches the futility and desperation he feels gnawing at him from inside and displays an engaging chemistry with the three drivers and with patricia arquette . the ambulance drivers more or less drove home the philosophical points of the film , as they acted out the insanity of the situation they were in and complemented his mood swings of being beaten down or hyper , with the sheer madness of their gall and sometimes perversive attitude toward the job . the photography was mesmerizing , capturing the hostile living conditions of the neighborhood and filling the screen at times with the beauty of a fire show amid the sirens and turbulence of the night , and in the background , we can see the famous city skyscrapers of the city shimmering in the night sky , seemingly changing colors . i'm glad that scorsese has made a film that asks a lot of questions of the viewer , questions that take time to answer because they are complex , and could best be answered by one's experience with matters of life and death . and from what is mentioned in the story , we learn that there are spirits that pull you one way or the other , and sometimes the pull is not to want to live anymore . that should give one something to think about . scorsese has made a technically perfect film and an artistic one , but is one that is not suited for everyone's taste , since it takes getting used to the trauma of the story and its appalling inertia ; but , the benefits are immense for those who stick with it . scorsese is undoubtedly one of the finest working directors and he knows how to provoke an audience to feel the pain of someone else , something that is very difficult to obtain in this medium . this is a very tough film to honestly say that you thoroughly enjoyed it , but what's more important than that , is how it lingers with you for a long time after seeing it and how compelling it is in a meaningful way . this film , i expect , will be better thought of than most films of the '90s that attempt to focus in on the city landscape , including all those films that were so entertaining but in the end were not as nurturing to the soul as this one was . it is easy to compare this film to his masterpiece , taxi driver , and say that both films were about a dying city , about someone who works by driving either a taxi or ambulance at night , and about a similar hero who had a tortured soul that needed redemption , but the former film was so much better because it had more action in it , more energy , and did not compromise the story's pessimism . but i found this film to be more subtle and more optimistic in a spiritual sense , and even its most pressing fault , that the subject matter hits too close to the miserable reality of things in the city and makes this a difficult film to sit through , should not be that deterring to the serious moviegoer . this film can't help being anything but a disturbing film , one that questions the degree of contemporary insanity , and it is not necessarily a better or worse film than the other one , but it is one that has more psychological layers of complexity to it that needs to be looked at more carefully .",DSc

"maybe it's envy , maybe it's years of hollywood trying to sell every pretty boy or gorgeous girl as the next big thing , and maybe it's some combination of the two . for whatever reason , both moviegoers and critics alike seem to have incredible difficulty acknowledging that attractiveness and talent could go hand in hand . when he won as best actor in 1987 for the color of money , it was widely considered a lifetime achievement award , but apparently newman had at least one more trick up his sleeve : nobody's fool , a small , quiet drama driven by newman's delightfully weathered lead performance . but during this holiday season , there are other opportunities . writer/director robert benton has a gift for making low-key , relationship-based films ( kramer vs . kramer , places in the heart ) , and nobody's fool is a worthy heir to that tradition . benton uses his snow-covered locations beautifully , practically turning north bath into one of the characters in the story . in many ways , nobody's fool is as much about north bath as it is about sully . that connectedness makes the relationships between characters in nobody's fool a rare joy . sully's feud with carl is one of the few external conflicts in the film , manifested primarily in a game of stealing a snow-blower back and forth , but even that exchange is essentially good-humored . it's one of the things that makes sully so appealing as a character : as ornery as he can be , he always treats people decently . it's ironic--and perhaps part of the point of nobody's fool--that the one relationship which seems forced is that between sully and peter . still , there's something strangely satisfying about a meeting between an estranged father and son which doesn't include a shouting match or tears . he has reached a point in his career where he doesn't really play characters any more ; instead , he slips into them like the flannel shirts sully favors . that is in no way meant to belittle what newman does as an actor . the fact is that he makes it all look effortless , as though he's really been sully all his life , and someone just happened to turn the camera on at this moment . the background for the character ( an abusive father , his own abandonment of his family ) seems almost tacked on so the movie seems to be about something more , but newman doesn't really need it . it's newman's gift that he can do all that with a well-placed sigh and a twinkle in those eyes .",SRe

"the yellow-colored y rays are tolerable , but the new green-colored z rays are pretty sinister . so what is the story about ? it's a murder mystery with romulus as a blend of the lead characters of shine , "" columbo , "" and the fisher king . jackson avoids all of the pitfalls of such a role , delivering a performance that makes romulus a complex character who deserves our sympathy and our understanding . director kasi lemmons , whose only other film was the acclaimed eve's bayou , has an acute sense of the visual . romulus's many surrealist dream sequences are particularly compelling , giving us an enhanced awareness of his pain . the caveman's valentine doesn't quite fit into any category . it's a fairly thin mystery but a heck of a character study . whatever it is , it keeps your eyes glued to the screen from beginning to end . without jackson to play the central role , the production would have been hopeless . it is rated r for language , some violence and sexuality and would be acceptable for older teenagers . just send me a letter with the word "" subscribe "" in the subject line .",SRh
"is it possible to parody a sport like wrestling , which is itself nothing but a parody ? in ready to rumble , director brian robbins , working from a hilarious script by steven brill , answers that question in the affirmative with the most outlandishly funny film since there's something about mary . with one over-the-top sequence after another , they make a film that you'll undoubtedly find either greatly awful or awfully great . the vast majority of our packed audience hooted and hollered and was clearly in the latter category , but there were a few walkouts , proving the film will not have quite universal appeal . his bombastic speech pumps up his adoring fans in the crowd . "" do you want to see me make diamond dallas page into one of my maids in waiting ? "" he bellows to a roaring audience . the last act is , of course , the big match . it is as side-splittingly funny as the rest of the picture , which produces an uncountable number of uncontrollable laughs . the movie's secret ingredient is its unusual choice of music . what sort of music comes to mind when you think of a bunch of sweaty guys trying to pulverize each other as a form of entertainment ? well , it did to the makers of ready to rumble , and proves a perfect match to this over-the-top production . it is rated pg-13 for language , crude humor , sexuality , brief male rear nudity and wrestling violence . but , it's a hard pg-13 . the movie would be fine for teenagers .",SRh
